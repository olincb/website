My name is Christopher Baillie Olin. If you know me professionally,
you probably know me as Chris. If you know me personally, you probably
call me Baillie. Either is fine with me.

I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, with a dual degree in computer science and mechanincal engineering.
My technical interests include (but are not limited to) programming languages, compilers, electronics, machine learning, and data science.

This spring (2023), I plan on spending about 3 months traveling around East and Southeast Asia, starting in Japan.

In my free time, I like listening to music and spending time outdoors.
I like mountain biking, road cycling, hiking, camping, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, and disc golf.
I love the Pacific Northwest because it serves as an excellent setting for all
of these things, and is beautiful year-round.

My contact information may be found at the top of [my resume](/resume).
