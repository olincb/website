My name is Christopher Baillie Olin. If you know me professionally,
you probably know me as Chris. If you know me personally, you probably
call me Baillie. Either is fine with me.

I am a student at the University of Maryland
pursuing a dual degree in mechanincal engineering and computer science.
My interests include (but are not limited to) electronics, machine learning,
data science, compilers and programming languages.

Outside of classes, I like to spend my time outdoors. I like rock climbing,
mountain biking, road cycling, hiking, camping, ultimate frisbee, and disc golf.
I love the Pacific Northwest because it serves as an excellent setting for all
of these things, and is beautiful year-round.
