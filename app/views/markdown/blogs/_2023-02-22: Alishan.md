This part of our trip was one of my favorites.

From Taipei we took the High Speed Rail to Chiayi, took a cab from Chiayi Station to Chiayi Station (not sure why they named both the train stations in the city the same thing…), and got on the Alishan Forest Train!

The forest train was easily the most beautiful train ride I’ve taken, winding into the mountains and seeing the trees change from palms to evergreens. Well I guess I haven’t been on that many trains… but it was beautiful regardless.

We got off the train at Fenqihu and explored the old streets there, with narrow alleys and tiny vendor stalls perched precariously on a crazy steep hill.

We caught a bus to our homestay on a tea farm for the next two nights. At this homestay we met a group of people I will never forget. 

Our host, Tan Yifang, was an incredibly kind, energetic, spunky Taiwanese woman who spoke very little English. Shortly after we arrived, as we were drinking tea with Yifang, she received a phone call. She quickly ran the phone to Grace and instructed her to answer it. Grace, Yifang and the guest on the phone spent the next 5 minutes figuring out if, when, and where Yifang could pick them up. 

The guest on the phone turned out to be Ann. She and her husband George ended up being great friends. This is the four of us.

We ended up seeing them again in Hualien, and I saw them a third time in Saigon, Vietnam.

After the first of many tea ceremonies, Yifang told us to get into her car and we were off, and we weren’t quite sure where. At some point up the mountain she stopped the car, got out, and said “You, go go go!” and made a walking gesture down a path. The path turned out to be lined with cherry blossoms.

At the end of the trail, just as we were wondering where to go, Yifang’s car came around the corner to take us away to the next trail.

This cycle of “Go go go!” or “You go!”, walking down a path, and Yifang appearing at just the right moment on the other end, continued at least three times.

The horizon here is supposed to look like a face. Possibly even two faces? Not sure.

Yifang told us where we could catch the best sunset views. We thought it was great but another guest with a very long camera showed us that the previous night’s sunset was better, and told us that it wasn’t as good because there was too much smog.

The next morning, Grace and I woke up early to catch this sunrise that wasn’t quite as impressive as the sunset…

Yifang and her husband (who she and the photographer-guest referred to as “The Boss”) explained to us that morning the importance of using tea pots with two spouts (isn’t breathing easier when you use both nostrils?). These were the only such teapots we found in all of Taiwan so we’re not sure if they were custom made.

This was the day we went into Alishan park itself. Sunrise up there would have been great to catch, as it’s generally above the “sea of clouds.”

Alishan felt a bit like stepping back into Bellingham, or maybe the Olympic peninsula. There were massive evergreens (some over a thousand years old), mist hanging around, moss on the rocks and trees, and ferns on the ground.

This shrine was built to honor the human- and tree-lives lost in the logging that occurred in this area.

The Three Generation Trees show where one tree fell, allowing a second to grow out of it, which then fell allowing a third to grow from the second.

I would have loved to see this man made stream bed with more water rushing through, but we were there at the wrong time of year for that.

The forest train we took from Chiayi to Fenqihu no longer connects to Alishan park due to damage from a landslide, but the top few stops still operate within the park.

Overall, it was _quite_ a beautiful day.

The following morning before we left for the bus, we made sure to get a photo with the whole crew, Yifang included.

We took the bus on the way down to Chiayi instead of the train again. It was long and incredibly windy, and like all bus drivers in Taiwan, our driver was going to get to the next stop _as fast as possible_. To make a long story short, we’d take the train both ways next time.

Next: Tainan.
