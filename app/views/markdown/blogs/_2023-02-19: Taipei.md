First I need to thank Grace for doing 99.9% of the planning for this trip, she did an _amazing_ job.

I only had 10 days with Grace in Taiwan, which is part of why I didn’t want to spend time making blog posts then. Also, we had a packed itinerary so there wasn’t a ton of downtime anyway.

I’ll date the Taiwan posts by the last day we were in each place, though again I’m writing this from later in my trip…

I will save all food related things for its own post, as the food overall was a highlight of the trip and it deserves its own section.

I caught the Pokémon train from the airport into Taipei and met up with Grace who had already been there for a few hours.

We caught sunset over the city from Taipei 101. I love that the city goes right up to the base of some mountains, it makes for gorgeous views and a very green city.

We were just in time for the end of the lantern festival in Taipei, where we saw countless large, highly detailed rabbit lanterns (it’s the year of the rabbit!).

The next morning we got up early to do a sunrise hike at elephant mountain. We were glad we did it early because there were far more people coming up as we were going down.

We visited the National Palace Museum, which was fascinating. Much of mainland China’s surviving ancient porcelain and jade is in Taiwan’s National Palace Museum, as it wasn’t destroyed by China’s cultural revolution in the 60s and 70s. The jade carvings were my favorite part. It’s a huge museum though, so we wished we had gone faster through some of the earlier parts to have more stamina for the jade section when we got there.

We also visited the 228 museum in Taipei, which recounted the horrific events of the massacre that occurred across Taiwan on February 28, 1947. I’m glad we went but it was a somber experience. [Here is the link to the Wikipedia article, if you’re interested in learning more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_28_incident).

We witnessed the lowering of the flag at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial, which was reminiscent of what you might see at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The memorial itself reminded me of the Lincoln Memorial.

I’m still a little confused as to why the CKS memorial is still reverent of him and guarded by soldiers, given that his government is not remembered fondly it seems. Perhaps it is more respect for history than reverence. There is a museum under it about his government and the [White Terror of CKS’s regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan)), and they have renamed parts of the Memorial grounds to be more freedom-oriented.

In Taipei we went to the first of many night markets, which were another highlight of the trip for me, mostly because there was so much good food to be eaten.

Raohe Street night market had 2 aisles, and was very long. Highlights were the black pepper buns and scallion pancakes.

That concluded our first 2 days in Taipei. Next: Alishan.
