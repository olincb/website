March 1st was the last day I was in Taiwan so I’ll use this date to talk about the food from the trip. The food, particularly the food from the night markets, was a highlight of the trip in and of itself. Here are some of the best things Grace and I ate in Taiwan:

Taiwan’s national dish: beef noodle soup! If I’m being honest I preferred the dry, non-soup noodles we had in Taiwan, but it was still delicious.

Bubble tea. Taiwan is the birth place of bubble tea, so of course we had it multiple times.

Various steamed buns. Sometimes filled or flavored with things like peanut, red bean, meat, taro, or sesame, and sometimes just plain dough. They used the same type of dough used for bao, which may or may not be familiar to you. It’s made out of rice I think, slightly sweet, and kind of chewy.

A delicious breakfast with hot soy milk, dumplings, a steamed bun, a sandwich where the filling was fried bread, and a rice roll.

Fenqihu (see: the post about Alishan) is famous for its bento boxes! We ate them in a small wooded park on a hill with a nice view.

At our homestay in Alishan, breakfast was provided both mornings. The first morning it was eggs, rice, sweet potatoes, and a steamed bun, and the second morning it was eggs, steamed greens, mushrooms, marinated fried tofu skin (I think?), a brown sugar steamed bun, peanuts, and sweet potato rice porridge.

In Tainan, we had hot pot for lunch one day which was delicious.

The second time we were in Taipei, we went to a Malaysian food restaurant. Grace stayed in Malaysia for a few months between highschool and college so she was in charge of ordering the good stuff.

## Snacks

Snacks in Asia have been __far__ more interesting than in the US. For example, the following types of chips:

- Szechuan chicken Doritos.
- Prawn Doritos.
- Unflavored Doritos.
- Hot pot Lays.
- Strawberry cheesecake Lays.
- many others

We also found this amazing chocolate bar candy which i’m pretty sure is Japanese:

## Daytime market fare

These were some things we got at markets that weren’t night markets.

At Anping old street in Tainan, we tried oyster rolls, shrimp crisps, peanut cilantro candy, and cow tongues (not as gross as it sounds, I’ll explain shortly). 

The oyster rolls didn’t particularly stand out to me, but they were good. Not much to say about them other than a good way to eat oysters.

The shrimp crisp vendor wanted to sell us a Costco-sized bag of them… When we told him we only wanted one or two crisps, _not_ one or two _bags_, he gave us a couple for free. The crisp makers made a huge __POP__ every time it finished making a crisp… not sure why.

I’m not a huge cilantro supporter because I have the gene that makes it taste like soap, but I have to say it still worked really well in this peanut cilantro candy. It was soft and chewy and delicious.

The cow tongues from this market were not real cow tongues, but long, flat, sweet biscuits. They were okay but only really worth it for the novelty of it.

Another non-night market we visited was within Alishan park, for lunch. I had the best meat-filled steamed bun of my life, which I think was made with mochi rather than a regular bun dough. We also had some sweet potatoes and other fried balls of some sort (honestly I don’t remember what the fried balls were, I can only remember how good the green steamed bun was).

## Night market fare

The night markets in Taiwan were _amazing_. I don’t remember specifically, but on our (11 day) trip I think we went to 7 or 8 night markets. Sadly, they’re not a very good place for remembering to take photos of what you’re eating, so I don’t have photos of everything we had. They’re a bit chaotic, and you have to walk around with whatever you’ve purchased and there’s always people in line behind you, so after you get something you usually have to move immediately (hence why I have sadly few photos of things from night markets). Things come in pretty small portions, which is great because you can try more things. But this also meant that by the time we left a market we wouldn’t always remember everything we had just eaten for dinner. Here are some things we got at night markets that stood out to me.

Fried sweet potato or taro balls. They’re chewy and sweet, perfect for dessert… or whenever.

Octopus balls. These were cooked in griddles with half-sphere dents in them, with the chef almost constantly spinning the balls around with chopsticks. They had onions, some other vegetables, shredded potatoes I think, octopus or squid, and it was all held together with an egg mixture.

Fried mushrooms. Very simple, but very very good. They usually had ~5 varieties of mushrooms, from tiny grass-like mushrooms to thick oyster mushrooms. Usually they were seasoned with a tasty but spicy spice blend.

Fried chicken bites. Once again, very simple. Just pieces of chicken, fried, and put on a stick. They often had the same spice seasoning as the fried mushrooms.

Sausage in a sausage was _really_ good. It’s like a hot dog, but the bun is a rice sausage, and the actual sausage actually tastes good.

There was another variation of this where they sliced both types of sausage and cooked them in a wok with some sweet basil and onions, which was SO good.

Sugar coated strawberries. I don’t really think strawberries need to be much sweeter, but these were very good. They had a glass-like, maybe 2mm thick, layer of hardened sugar over ~4 strawberries, on a stick. Another option at these stalls was the same but with cherry tomatoes… which we never tried.

Black pepper buns. These were famous at the Raohe night market, which was our first night market. They were crispy on the outside, as they were baked rather than steamed like most buns in Taiwan. They were filled with yummy stuff (don’t really remember what) and had black pepper on the outside.

Scallion pancakes. These were savory crepe-pancakes with small slices of scallion in them.

Oyster omelette. I would say I favored the oyster omelette to the oyster buns from Tainan. They were… pretty much how you would expect an oyster omelette to be.

Mochi covered strawberries. Some had a plain dough, some a red bean dough, and some a matcha dough. We had these from the last night market we went to, and ate them in the airport before Grace left.

At the Keelung night market, Grace and I had some pork vermicelli noodles with the Taiwanese couple we met in Hualien.

Also at the Keelung night market, we had some peanut shaved ice. It wasn’t creamy like ice cream, but it had a similar texture. Perhaps it was a closer texture to Sorbet or sherbet.

Guabao. Guabao is like a Taiwanese hamburger… It uses the same chewy sweet rice dough that the steamed buns are made of, and it folds around a meat and vegetable filling. I think it was one of my favorite things.

Now for the more controversial items… both of these took me the whole trip to work up the courage to eat, and I had them on our second to last night.

Pigs blood cake is made from congealed pigs blood, and is coated in peanuts and cilantro. Other than the constant unpleasantness of the thought of what you’re eating, there is nothing about these that is gross. It had a mild flavor and a slightly chewy texture.

Stinky tofu was present at every market we went to, and it was not hard to identify. They truly do not call it stinky tofu for nothing. It really smells foul. It’s essentially just tofu that’s gone bad and begun to ferment. However… it turned out to taste pretty good. _Much much_ better than it smells, anyway. And once you get it, it doesn’t smell quite as bad either. The stalls that cook it are where most of the smell comes from. Glad I tried it!

There was undoubtedly more, but these were the best and the most memorable things.
