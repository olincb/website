When I got into Bangkok I had a bit more of an adventure getting to my hostel than I bargained for. I missed the stop I should have gotten off the van at, and ended up getting off at the next stop. Unfortunately, the fastest way to my hostel was basically to backtrack to the previous stop on foot. I asked a cab driver about it but it seemed a bit pricey so I toughed it out on foot (too used to the non-Bangkok prices, I guess... I'm sure it wasn't really that expensive).

Anyway, my route back to the MRT station (where I should have gotten off in the first place) brought me first through a market where I had some delicious pad Thai, and then through this nice park/garden. It had ponds with islands and bridges like this one:

Finally getting back to the MRT station, I found a sign I thought was funny, which reminded me of one of the foods I needed to try while I was still in Thailand...

Even after getting to the MRT, though, I had a deceptively long journey to the hostel. When I got off at the closest station, I had a long walk through a neighborhood and then over a bridge. I had some interesting directions to follow through the neighborhood, but instead of describing it I'll just leave a video here.

Finally I made it to my hostel, much later in the day than I anticipated. I guess I got some daytime sightseeing in, in the form of the garden (which was actually on my list of things to do) and also seeing a little slice of local life as I walked through the neighborhood (not on my list but I like that part of travel a lot). But I was expecting to have a bit more time for checking off things on my list than I really ended up with. Alas, that's also part of travel (the way I've come to like to do it, anyway).

On my side goal of eating all the color-named curries, I had some red curry near my hostel.

I also had yellow curry at some point, because I wrote it down in my phone's notes, but I don't have a photo of it and I don't remember where exactly it was... But rest assured, I completed my goal.

I had heard great things about a night market called Jodd Fairs (I was confused at first why people were talking about a job fair) so I went there after dinner for some perusing and some dessert. 

I was surprised by how modern it felt, compared to all the other night markets I've been to. It gave me hip shopping mall vibes instead of hole-in-the-wall street food vibes. There was live music at one end which was nice.

It delivered on the interesting dessert front. These little green worms in coconut milk taste much better than they look. I'm not sure what they're made of, but it's probably rice and sugar and something to make it green.

I also was able to fulfill my goal of eating some durian. I could have purchased a pack of durian and had it straight, but I wasn't confident I'd like it so I got durian sticky rice.

Durian is surprisingly expensive even by American fruit standards, especially considering every other fruit is ridiculously cheap. I don't think I would have it again, but I'm glad I tried it. Honestly it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. The texture was kind of buttery which was nice but the flavor was a bit rotten.

The next day was my last full day in Thailand. I kind of accepted that with really just 1 day in Bangkok I wasn't going to come close to seeing everything I wanted to, so I just kept taking things at my pace, enjoying things instead of rushing them. I started by accidentally finding a fish market on my way to a temple that had been recommended to me.

At the aforementioned temple, I found a nice Buddha as usual, but also some surprisingly grim paintings on the walls...

I took the ferry to my next destination. The ferries go up and down the Chao Phraya River like buses; it was incredibly convenient to get anywhere what was near the river. My next destination was Wang Lang Market, where I decided to look for a charm for the necklace I always wear. After not a ton of luck finding something that caught my eye, I went into the inside of a jewelry shop. I discovered I could have a pendant custom made from any of the stone beads in their massive boxes of assorted stones. After a _lot_ of indecision, I walked out with a custom pendant on my necklace.

Next stop was... \*checks notes\*... Wat Rakhang Kositaram Woramahawihan. Say that ten times fast. Anyway, it was particularly cool because the chedis and temples here look like what Ayutthaya would have looked like back when everything was pristine, hundreds of years ago.

I took the ferry across the river again, this time to the Royal Palace. It was surrounded by temples and statues like these.

The palace itself was beautiful too.

I kind of wish I had hired one of the tour guides that was hawking their services at the entrance to the palace, because my self-guided tour of the grounds wasn't particularly illuminating, other than important observations like "that looks cool" (it was indeed very beautiful, but I wish I could have had more cultural/historical/architectural context).

My ticket for the palace came with admission to a historical Thai dance performance. So I hired a Grab scooter to take me to the theater, and made it just in time for the last show of the day. They showed dances from various regions of Thailand, from various time periods, with English text descriptions flashing across a sign above the stage.

When the performance was over I had a to-do item to take care of. I wanted to pick up my Japan Rail Pass while outside of Japan, because it saves you like $70. After a series of showing up at the wrong places (travel agency office no longer exists at certain address, this office doesn't sell them but our headquarters does), I finally found an office where they'd sell me one.

My wild goose chase ended up being worth it, not only for the savings on the pass, but also because I met a good friend while waiting for it. A Danish guy named Jakob was also getting his Japan Rail Pass, and we'd be in Japan at the same time!

We went to the mall next door, called Terminal 21, to get some coffee. It was pretty late so I got tea but I think Jakob is either severely addicted or just doesn't get affected by caffeine or something. Terminal 21 was very cool, it was a recommendation from Sean, the American I met in Ayutthaya, and he is the authority on malls in foreign countries (weird thing to be into in my opinion but he was passionate about them). Anyway, this mall is themed after a different city from around the world for each level, and taking the escalator between floors is like taking a plane between them.

Jakob and I chatted for a long time about our travels so far and our plans for Japan. Sadly, we had itineraries that didn't overlap much, but we decided we would make sure to see each other in Japan at least once.

The next morning, I had to get up pretty early to make my flight to Singapore. I was running a bit late (story of my life) so when a taxi driver offered a ride, I gladly took it. I think he was excited I accepted his first offer for price to the airport instead of trying to haggle him down. I also think it was more expensive than it should have been because the meter stayed covered by a small cloth the whole time.

At the airport, I tried a recommendation from Jakob the coffee man. An absolute abomination which was an Americano but with orange juice instead of water. It was actually pretty good, which was _shocking_.

Next up: Singapore, for 12 hours.
