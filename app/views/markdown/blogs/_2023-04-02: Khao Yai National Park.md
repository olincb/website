The train from Ayutthaya to Pak Chong (closest station to Khao Yai National Park) was the oldest, clunkiest, and windiest train I've been on. It was still quite hot and there was no AC, so every window on the train was completely open.

Contrary to what I originally said on April fools day, I kept all limbs inside the train and made it to Pak Chong in one piece.

The hostel I was going to stay at didn't accept late check in, so I had to rebook at a place closer in to town (which was actually pretty convenient since it was much closer to the train station). However, I had booked a wildlife tour through the original hostel so it was less convenient the next morning when I had to wake up earlier for them to pick me up.

We had three other people for the tour, in addition to a guide, whose name was Teh. The four of us sat in the back of a pickup truck (like a lao-style tuk tuk, or the truck I was driven to and from the Gibbon Experience in), and Teh drove us around and told us when to get out to see some animals.

We were wildly impressed with his spotting skills though... The first stop we made, we saw this hornbill (I don't remember what subspecies, but there were two of them).

Without binoculars, it was nearly impossible to spot. I brought my own binoculars, and Teh had a monocular on a tripod that he set up for us to take turns looking through whenever there was wildlife to see. Also when we did this, he would take our phones and take photos and videos through the monocular for us.

The view from the entrance road here was also pretty crazy.

Next, we stopped multiple times to see gibbons. It was interesting that we were able to get so close to the gibbons here, because at the Gibbon Experience, I felt like they implied you couldn't get close to them at all without them fleeing. And at the Gibbon Experience we saw only one family of gibbons, while here we saw many. But, in Khao Yai they were not doing the crazy insane singing like they were at the Gibbon Experience.

Eventually, we stopped at a trailhead and took to the trails. Much of the entire journey in the park I documented with videos instead of photos, but there were a few key moments I photographed... like this cicada husk on my nose.

And this fig tree you could walk inside.

Later, we spotted the other subspecies of hornbill. This one wouldn't come out of its hole in the tree, so we only saw its bill.

For lunch, some sweet and sour tofu from a restaurant inside the park.

It was around this point where our path was blocked by a tree that had fallen in the road. People were working on clearing it, but it was going to be a while so we backtracked to spend some time looking at macaques.

I spent some time practicing taking photos through my binoculars using my phone camera. In particular, this baby macaque made an excellent subject.

This adult male macaque looks very pensive. Not three minutes before this photo we had witnessed him mating with another macaque.

Unexpectedly, after we got past the tree in the road, we found a movie set where they were filming what appeared to be a movie about a prince and princess, or something like that.

After leaving the movie set (the actual attraction there was a waterfall, but the tiny amount of water this time of year meant the movie set was far more interesting), we had some chips and bottled soy milk as a quick snack. Weirdly, all of us chose the soy milk in a glass bottle independently, from all sorts of more standard soft drinks and beverages.

We spent some time at a popular elephant road crossing, but had no luck finding any elephants.

We continued through the park, and stopped to observe this fascinating flock of photographers. Oh, and the little dog- or fox-like creatures they were photographing. Teh set up his monocular and we got some videos of them hanging out.

The clouds as we left the park were crazy beautiful.

I was originally planning on camping in the park like I had done in Pang Oung, but along with the pretty clouds came the sound of thunder so I felt like it might be better to have a roof over my head that night.

Just as we were leaving, Teh got a call from his underground elephant spotting network about an elephant outside the park entrance. We jumped in the truck and zoomed out of the park to see it.

By the time we got there, it was dark. The elephant had left the park, and was walking through the neighboring town. Some of the residents and their dogs were doing their best to shoo it back into the park and away from their town. They eventually succeeded I think, but not before the elephant went through the outdoor seating area of a restaurant or cafe, throwing huge boxes aside like they were nothing. The elephant didn't seem to like the dogs that were bravely barking at it, and it trumpeted at them a few times. The elephant seemed incredibly stressed out, but I think everyone was doing the right thing in trying to get it back into the park where it is safe and everyone else is safe from it.

We got back to the hostel (the one through which I booked the tour) and I booked a room for the night. I had green curry there for dinner (no picture sadly). I realized I was getting to the end of my time in Thailand and I hadn't tried all three colors of curry, so I had to get to work fixing that.

The next morning, I had one of my favorite breakfasts, fried basil, or Kapow. I'm not sure if it's standard for Thai people to eat it for breakfast but nobody ever looked at me weird when I ordered it in the morning.

The hostel owner suggested I take a van back to Bangkok instead of the train because its more comfortable and faster, which I completely believed after the shitter train I took from Ayutthaya. He arranged a ride for me from the hostel to the van station in Pak Chong, and all the way through to Bangkok.
