I’m writing this much later (from Vietnam) but I’ll keep the date from when it happened…

Feb. 17 was my last full day in Tokyo. On the 16th, I took the train from Lake Kawaguchiko back into Shinjuku, then down to Kamakura. I got there pretty late, but managed to find some fish and mustard greens over rice for dinner from a restaurant/bar (the gyoza were already eaten before I remembered to take a photo).

And dessert from a convenience store.

For breakfast I finally worked up the courage for another classic Japanese breakfast: raw egg and rice.

My whole day was spent exploring the area around Kamakura, walking to various points of interest on Google Maps, and along whatever cool looking trails I could find on AllTrails. The town extends right up into some hills which were great for some light hiking. I found a neighborhood road that turned into this tunnel straight from Spirited Away (there was no spirit world on the other side, unfortunately).

I visited a Zen Buddhist temple with some _immaculate_ gardens.

I had some matcha there, with a view of the bamboo garden.

Afterwards, I found a trail on AllTrails that turned out to be an old pilgrimage road for the temple I was just visiting. Following some more trails up into the hills rewarded me with some crazy views.

After finding a way back to town I got shumai, deer loaf cutlet, and croquette (left to right) for lunch from a tiny meat shop, for basically pennies.

In the afternoon I took a bus to this massive Buddhist statue. There was a garden of trees that were planted as gifts from Thai royalty over the years, which was interesting.

I caught the train to the airport (my flight was early on the 18th so I booked a hostel in Narita), and caught one final glimpse of Fujisan as the sun was setting.

On the train I made another sketch of Fuji from a photo I had taken the previous day.

I arrived in Narita pretty late so my last dinner in Japan (until next time) was convenience store sushi.

On the plane to Taiwan I made yet another Fuji sketch.

I also made a 1 second everyday video for my time in Tokyo:

Next up: Taiwan, with Grace!
