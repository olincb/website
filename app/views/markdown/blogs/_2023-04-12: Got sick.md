As I was eating dinner in Dotonbori in Osaka, I started feeling a bit chilly. Then very chilly...

By the time I got back to the hostel I was feeling extremely ill and feverish.

The next day I checked into a single room, to avoid spreading whatever I had. I spent two days finding two covid tests, which were both negative. This was my view for the next few days:

I lost around four days of my trip to this illness, whatever it was. To be perfectly honest, it sucked a lot. I felt really guilty about not maximizing my time, especially as the end of the trip was looming.

I ordered most of my meals from Uber eats and ate them in my room.

My first meal out once I was feeling a bit better was some soba (with some raw egg on rice!).

I started to feel well enough to do things pretty much right as my hotel room reservation was up. Luckily, before I got sick I had done most of the things I wanted to do in Osaka. I had planned originally on just staying in Osaka and doing day trips to Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe. After I spent that time instead just shut up in a room, I decided to actually go stay in Kyoto next, instead of just doing day trips there.
