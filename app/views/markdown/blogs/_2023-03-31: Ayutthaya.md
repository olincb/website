I made the train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, and after tickets were collected, I walked halfway up the train to join my travel buddies Dominic and Alessandro. Their bunkmates were around my age which was cool and a relatively uncommon demographic on this train so that was lucky. Potter was a Thai guy who was studying at the university in Chiang Mai. The other person was a Philipino girl who was travelling, and about to fly to China. Sadly none of us remember her name (at time of writing, a month later). We all compared the designs of our various passports and currencies which was very fun. Swiss currency takes the cake by far, but the passports were pretty equally cool.

Pictured from left to right is me, Potter, and Dominic.

When we arrived in Bangkok in the morning, we had an hour at the station before our connection to Ayutthaya. We had veggies, rice and eggs for breakfast.

Alessandro and Dominic were shocked by how much chili sauce and slices I put on my breakfast, so Alessandro documented the moment as well.

On the train from Bangkok to Ayutthaya, we met an American from San Francisco named Sean. He sadly enforced some American stereotypes when he thought Swiss meant you're from Sweden...

We forgave his blunder and still met up with him later for sightseeing and lunch.

I met my match in my newfound travel spontaneity in Dominic and Alessandro... the three of us booked our accomodation for the night in Ayutthaya after we had arrived in the train station in Ayutthaya. We decided to get a room with three beds, which was nice after so much time in 8-12 person hostel dorms for me.

After dropping off our bags and getting recommendations from our host on where to go, we set off to explore the city.

Much of the city was long ago a huge temple complex, which have since become very impressive ruins. On our way to some of the ruins, we found this man wading around a pond, harvesting seeds from the lily plants.

We spent much of the day exploring the ruins that stretched across much of the city. In fact, it's almost hard to call it a city. The modern (by Thai standards) buildings pretty much just encompass the temple complex ruins and that's it. It didn't really feel like there was a city center or anything like that; just the historical area in the middle.

This day and the next couple were unbearably hot, and pretty humid too. It made a day of walking and cycling (we rented some bicycles) two or three times as draining as it would have otherwise been.

Nonetheless, we were determined to spend the whole day out there seeing what Ayutthaya had to offer.

We learned from Sean that the ruins are not actually as old as they look, and they appear so weathered due to plundering from Cambodian (if I remember correctly...) invaders, who set everything ablaze after stealing what treasure they could. Many of the religious structures contain treasures as offerings inside, which are not really meant to be disturbed, looked at, or even opened at all. But a temple complex with so many of these structures must have been an attractive target for invading armies.

Sadly, one attraction in Ayutthaya is elephant riding. It's incredibly inhumane and is one of the last places you can do it in Thailand. Despite this, it seemed to be relatively popular.

A weirdly common position for large Buddha statues is the "reclining Buddha." Ayutthaya has one too.

That night, we went to a festival that was set up in one of the open areas around some of the ruins. There were song and dance performances and some short plays, many food stalls to choose from, and local art on display.

Among other things, I had sweet sticky rice in a unique vessel.

It was here we met the most fascinating Thai man. He seemed to be the least Thai Thai person. He asked me if a curry I had ordered was spicy, because he _hates_ spicy food. We sat down to eat with him, and ended up talking to him for hours. He told us about how people in Thailand percieve the government and the King, as well as why they loved the previous king (Rama IX) so much. It was so much fun talking with him.

The next day, we had an easy morning waiting for our trains. We had coffee and pastries at a western boutique coffee shop, and we stayed there for a long time because the air conditioning was too nice to leave. After hanging out there basically until lunch time, we went to the restaurant right across the street before going to the train station.

Dominic had to leave soon, so he was bound for Bangkok. Alessandro had been invited to stay at an acquaintance's house in southern Thailand, so he was passing through Bangkok as well. With only a few more days in Thailand myself, I decided I needed to make the most of my time and go the opposite way, to Khao Yai National Park. Thus, we said goodbye, and parted ways.

My train was a few hours after theirs so I got some food, found another air conditioned cafe, and wrote a blog post.

The train station was on the other side of this river which we crossed by a little passenger ferry. One time, though, my crossing was slightly delayed by this _massive_ barge that went through.

Eventually, I boarded my train and was off for Khao Yai National Park.
