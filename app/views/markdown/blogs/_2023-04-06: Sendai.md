When I landed in Tokyo, I immediately exchanged my voucher for a Japan Rail Pass. It ended up actually taking longer to stand in line for the JR pass than to get through customs because they were so busy. After I got the pass, I got on the Shinkansen for the first time, from Tokyo to Sendai.

Before boarding, I purchased a bento box and ate it on the train. They don't have food cars on Shinkansens like they do on Amtraks, for example. Instead, there are many vendors in the stations (past the ticket gates) where you can get all sorts of take out food and bento boxes prior to catching your train.

When I got to Sendai, I had some time to kill before I could check into my hostel, so I walked through some parks instead of taking the local trains from the station where the Shinkansen dropped me.

The whole reason I wanted to go to Sendai was to catch the peak bloom of the sakuras (cherry trees). It was a warmer spring than usual so the blooms happened earlier than usual. This meant that I had to go further north (Sendai) than my original plan of seeing them somewhere south of Tokyo like Osaka.

The parks on the way to my hostel really delivered.

In most parks in the city, there were huge numbers of people relaxing, eating and drinking with their friends and families under and around the cherry blossoms. It's such a common practice that there's a word for it: Hanami.

After my leisurely stroll through the pink and white sakuras of Sendai, I checked into my hostel and just relaxed for a bit, which was nice after about a day and a half of traveling. The hostel was simple but cozy; a very homey place. In fact, the building was next door to the owners' house. One of the owners showed me around with one of their younger employees translating when she struggled to find the right word for something in English.

That was something I noticed much more this time I was in Japan compared to the first time, when I was mostly just in and around Tokyo. Outside of the very touristy areas, people tend not to have very strong English in Japan. It was surprising to me that of all the countries I visited, the language barrier was strongest in the most developed one (barring Singapore, I suppose, whose country was probably the most advanced and also whose English was the best).

That evening, the owner made us all a delicious steak dinner for the incredible price of 1000 yen, or about $7.50. Before running a hostel, he worked as a chef, and his skills definitely showed. Sadly I don't remember his name.

After dinner, and after chatting with the other guests and the staff (who ate dinner with us), a group of us decided to go to a bar. Momoko (an employee who I learned had started just two days prior) got permission from the owner to join us after her shift, because she wasn't sure if there were rules against hanging out with guests.

This was our little crew on our way back from the bar.

The next morning, before I checked out, we got a selfie that included Ellie-san and Tobi who had not joined us the night before.

I checked to see if I could extend my stay at the hostel another night or two, because I loved the atmosphere and the people and the staff at the hostel. In fact, I would go so far as to say it was my favorite hostel I stayed in my entire trip. Sadly, they were all booked up that night so I stayed with my original plan of continuing to Osaka that evening.

I left my bag at the hostel for the day so I could do some sightseeing unencumbered before I had to catch my train to Osaka. My first stop was another park in Sendai for some Hanami. There turned out to be a little festival of sorts almost. Or rather, there were tents set up for food vendors like you might expect at a festival, but otherwise everyone was just hanging out and picnicking. I got a snack of rice wrapped in pork on a stick, and a pancake dessert that was filled with chocolate.

Next, I walked to Sendai castle... or the location where Sendai castle formerly stood. It's up on a hill, and the lower walls are still intact, which makes the approach a bit circuitous (an advantageous property for a castle). The castle itself no longer stands, but there's an awesome view of Sendai from the top and some history to read about and some statues to check out.

I was eating a snack I brought on a bench and coincidentally met a family who were also from the US. They were visiting Sendai because that's where their father (also with them) was from before he moved to the US.

After the castle, I took the local train a few stops down to a spot recommended to me from another guest at the hostel. It ended up being one of the most beautiful single scenes of my entire trip. I wish I had gone there a bit earlier, as I felt a bit rushed while I was there, and didn't have much time to enjoy it before I had to get back to the Shinkansen station.

I made it back to the hostel, grabbed my backpack, and got to Sendai Station just in time to catch my train to Osaka (which was actually a train to Tokyo, followed by a different train to Osaka).
