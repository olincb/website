After an early exit from the incredibly strange love hotel in Otani, I took the train three stops down with the crowds of commuting schoolchildren to Koyaguchi. I packed two day's worth of necessities in my day bag, and stored my big bag in a coin locker at the train station, before making my way to Jison-in Temple, the start point of the Choishi-michi Pilgrimage Road. It starts with a large staircase next to this pagoda.

When the temple complex at Koyasan was founded (by a monk named Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism), this "road" was the only way to access it. Really, it's nothing more than a hiking trail with some stone steps every now and then. That's not to downplay how impressive it is, though: sections of it are too narrow for livestock and wagons so the massive stones used for the steps and road markers were hauled up the mountain by hand.

In total, I think it was around 13 miles from Jison-in to Koyasan.

In case you missed it in the video, here's one of the very cool beetles I found in my path along the way.

The trail ends at this gate, the Daimon gate, which is very impressive.

I thought this was the end of my pilgrimage but upon inspection of a town map, the pilgrimage route was shown to continue to Okunoin, a cemetery housing the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi. So I visited a number of temples on my way across the town to the cemetery.

When I reached the cemetery, I found this gravestone to be particularly interesting...

The cemetery may have been the most magestic and impressive part of the entire pilgrimage, to be honest. There was something so beautiful and mysterious about it. I think videos do it more justice than photos, so I would recommend watching the end of the video above if you haven't already.

Kobo Daishi's mausoleum was incredibly serene. Photography was prohibited in and around it, so I have nothing to show for it, but it was truly powerful. Kobo Daishi is believed to have entered an eternal meditation rather than dying, and so is still meditating in the mausoleum.

On my way to my guesthouse after the conclusion of my pilgrimage, the sun was setting, making the plants in the town look incredible.

The guesthouse owner recommended a particular restaurant for dinner, so I went there and had some sweet and sour chicken. I believe most of the things on the menu were actually Chinese.

The hostel owner was actually full of incredible recommendations to make the most of my time in Koyasan. He recommended I return to Danjo-garan temple, as there is a large bell there that gets rung a few times per day, and the next time would be 11 pm. So I returned and waited for them to ring the bell.

It turned out that this apparently very normal guy was the one to ring the bell. He and a group of tourists were chatting about it for a bit, then he just walked up to the bell to start ringing it at 11. The tourists he was talking to and I were surprised about it, expecting it to be rung by a monk, or at least someone wearing something other than normal street clothes...

Here's a video of it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend watching all of it, if you've heard it ring once you've heard it ring a thousand times. It was really cool though. I'm not sure the video gives the sense of how powerful it was: it was very loud but you could also feel it in your chest when it rang.

The next morning, I woke up _extremely_ early to watch the daily ritual at Okunoin (also a recommendation of the guesthouse owner). The ritual starts at 6 am every morning (and has, daily, for the past 1200 years), but it was advised to get there about 15 mintues early, and it was about a 35 minute walk from the guesthouse through the cemetery to the mausoleum. At this time of day, up on the mountain, it was extremely cold, and I had not packed appropriately in my little day bag. So I wore every shirt I brought with me, and my rain jacket on top.

The ritual is called Shojinku, and in this ceremony the monks bring food to Kobo Daishi in his deep meditation. Here is a photo of them, before we crossed the bridge into the innermost part of the temple where the mausoleum is, and where photography is prohibited.

A small group of people followed the monks, including myself, one other foreign tourist, a couple Japanese tourists, and a Japanese pilgrim (an actual pilgrim, not my version of just doing the hike because it was cool). Upon entering Okunoin temple itself, we sat behind the monks, and were guided in meditation for an hour. This may have been one of the coolest and most genuine experiences I had on my trip. After our meditation, the monks completed the ritual, though only the highest ranking monk is allowed to visit Kobo Daishi with the food so that was obviously something we could not observe. Our little group slowly dispersed, and the pilgrim and locals lingered, completing the payment of their respects.

I returned to the guesthouse and had an ironically western breakfast (after the most genuine eastern experience of the trip).

I decided I didn't need to do the pilgrimage in both directions, so I took the tram down the mountain back to Koyaguchi. It's incredible to me how remote a destination can be reached by public transit in Japan.

I picked up my big backpack from the coin locker I had left it in the day before, and continued on my way to Kobe!
