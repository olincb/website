I spent the last 5 days relaxing in La Quinta (near Palm Springs) with Grace, her mom Carolyn, and our friend Jill, who hosted us at her home there.
We: went on a bike ride; drove through and hiked in Joshua Tree National Park;
watched Jill’s friends play tennis; watched Jill play tennis; visited Sunnylands;
played a _lot_ of pickle ball, including a lesson from Jan (pronounced Yan);
browsed an art festival in old town La Quinta; relaxed in Jill’s hot tub;
watched some movies; ate two (2) lasagnas; and picked fresh grapefruits from a nice neighbor’s tree.
Overall, it was an amazing time with some amazing people. 

Here are a few photos!

Right now, I’m with my friend Max in LA for the day. My flight to Japan is __TONIGHT!__ I can’t believe it.
