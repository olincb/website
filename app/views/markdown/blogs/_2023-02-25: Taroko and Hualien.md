After arriving and settling into our hotel in Hualien, Grace and I decided to explore for a bit. We knew George and Ann would be in Hualien at the same time as us, and we had planned on texting them. Before we had a chance to text them though… we completely coincidentally ran into them on the street! We made plans to get dinner.

We spent the afternoon checking out the beach, which was lined with these massive concrete things that looked like jacks. The beach was pretty but the waves were not very inviting…

Before dinner we found an American-themed bar for happy hour and spent a while talking to the bar tender, who was from Taipei and was in Hualien studying Japanese at university.

We met up with George and Ann for a yummy hibachi dinner near their hotel. It was so good to see them again! The next time I would see them was in Saigon.

After dinner, Grace and I said our goodbyes and went to the night market in Hualien for some dessert! This night market seemed more permanent then the others we had been to, and also much less cramped… though the bigger crowds here filled up the extra space between the stalls so it still felt pretty tight. It was a holiday weekend for them so there were a lot more people there than usual.

After the night market, Grace and I looked for a bar but found a craft brewery! Once again, some stronger ales were nice compared to to much more common lagers in Asia.

At the brewery, we met and chatted with a couple from Taipei. Tony is a CEO of a company that works with natural gas transport in Taiwan. They were incredibly nice and ended paying for our drinks. The bar tender/brewery owner, if I understood correctly, was formerly a doctor who helped one of their family members fight cancer and win. All in all, another very interesting group of people to have met coincidentally.

The next morning (the 25th), we chartered a guide (a knowledgeable taxi driver who spoke almost no english) to take us around Taroko National Park. With only 1 day for the park, I think this was really the way to go, even though we weren’t able to do any of the much longer hikes. Next time though, I would get the trail permit early and choose a longer trail to do. In particular the Zhiulu Old Road looks incredible.

Our driver took us to various points in the park and communicated to us that we should go down a trail and he’d be on the other side, or to go down and back, or to explore at our leisure and be back at a certain time.

Within the park are some indigenous villages, where we bought some woven bracelets and a sausage for lunch. I didn’t know it at the time but that bracelet would be the start of a small collection of braces purchased from local people in various countries.

The cliffs and gorges there were unfathomably large. I don’t think even the photos do the scale of it justice.

Some of the waters in the tributary streams were insanely blue and clear.

We were told the rock formation on which this pagoda sits looks like a frog. I kind of saw it but wouldn’t have thought that on my own…

There were plenty of suspension bridges in the park which our guide thought were all excellent opportunities for photo shoots.

I think the fact that you can’t see the sky in this photo is a testament to just how large it was.

We took some time to explore this incredibly impressive temple, which was destroyed twice by landslides, and was moved to the left for its third construction to avoid the landslide-prone area visible on the right.

This was the start of the path to a bell tower high on the cliffs.

The temple visible here was close to where the previous photo was taken.

A bit further down the path we found a seemingly abandoned memorial with more impressive views of the gorge.

After we finished exploring the park, our tour guide took us to the beach for a bit. Once again, the waves were not particularly inviting. I swear they must have been 8 feet tall on average when they crashed…

Overall, it was an amazing day and a highlight of the trip for me.
