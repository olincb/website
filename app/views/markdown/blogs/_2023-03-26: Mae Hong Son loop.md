The Mae Hong Son loop is a route commonly driven by motorbike in the Mae Hong Son province of Thailand, starting and ending in Chiang Mai.

I decided to do the loop clockwise, which would start me on relatively easy roads and finish the last day on the notoriously windy road between Pai and Chiang Mai. A good plan for someone new to riding a scooter. However, I decided to include a detour which basically threw me right in the deep end to begin with anyway...

I went to Doi Inthanon national park, which is home to the Kew Mae Pan nature trail and the highest point in Thailand.

The Kew Mae Pan nature trail is a relatively easy but very popular hike, where they've employed dozens of hill tribe locals as trekking guides (you're not allowed to do the hike without paying for a guide).

My guide, I think, was named Chai. This is also the word for "yes" in Thai, though, so it's very possible something just got lost in translation and she was just responding yes. On the other hand, it's very possible that's a real name because most of the hill tribes in SE Asia speak their own language, not the language of the country they happen to be in.

She was surprisingly old to be guiding treks through the mountains, but she was totally capable and impressively fit. She was eager to take my photo for me at every opportunity, but her guiding skills were better than her photography skills and most photos also featured her finger blurring the right corner of the picture.

She spoke basically no English which was not really a problem but it made for some pretty sparse conversations.

I have many photos from the hike but I made a little video which I think gives a much better sense of it.

After the hike, I continued my detour up for a photo at Thailand's highest point.

Continuing from Doi Inthanon to my destination for the night (Mae Sa Riang), I encountered the worst roads of the entire loop. It took pretty much all my concentration to dodge the potholes in the road which switched often between gravel and cracked pavement.

This was also the second and final time in my trip where I thought I was in danger (mistakenly, both times). I was passed by a pickup carrying about 6 people, apparently farm workers. But right as they passed me, one of them put on a home-made patchwork head mask that looked kind of like a ski mask one might wear to rob a bank, with eye holes and a mouth hole. I was certain I was about to be kidnapped.

But they just drove away. I (much later) found out that this sort of thing is normal in Thailand, and the goal is to avoid sun exposure. Having dark, tanned skin is considered to be unattractive because it implies the need to perform manual labor outside. So people who do spend a lot of time outside will sometimes keep their skin as pale as possible by covering every inch of their body, even in the crazy heat of Thailand.

My mountain detour and the fact that I left a bit later in the morning than I originally planned to, meant that the last part of my scoot to Mae Sa Riang was after dark. But this blessed me with a very cool view of the wild fires that were happening. They lit up the forests orange against the otherwise very dark background.

As I continued, though, the fires got closer and closer to the road, to the point where eventually I could feel the heat off the fires and the smoke made my eyes sting. Luckily, the fires were all small, and there was no wind. The fires didn't really touch the trees, but just burnt the underbrush.

After getting to my hostel I found one of the few restaurants still open and had some pad se ew. The owner was an interesting man, whose name was Sam An. He sounded angry every time he spoke English, but I realized he was actually incredibly sweet and was not actually angry. He asked me to come back for breakfast at the same place, so of course that became the plan.

The next morning, the sun rose over the mountains and I was able to see the result of the fires I was driving through the previous night... smoke completely blocking the view of the mountains.

I went back to Sam An's restaurant for breakfast, just as he was opening. It was just him, so I helped him move his eggs from the bag he bought them in into an egg holder while he chopped some onions and vegetables. We chatted for a bit and soon the conversation got shockingly personal, and he told me how he had just lost his wife. He said everything was fine and he's strong, but I still worry about him. I hope he's okay.

Leaving the restaurant to continue on my carefree journey after hearing about his late wife felt insensitive, but I wasn't sure what else to do, so I gave my deepest condolences and departed.

For day 2 of the loop, my goal was to make it somewhere near Mae Hong Son (the town for which the province is named). I wanted to camp at Pang Oung and I had heard from some other backpackers that you can just show up to the parks with campgrounds and they'll provide tents and bedding. So for this night I set off with no lodging booked.

My first detour was to Phrathat Thammikarat temple in the mountains. I arrived to the welcome noise of about twenty dogs barking visciously at me. I parked my scooter and spent about ten minutes slowly approaching them, trying to show them I was not a threat. _Finally_, one of them came up and sniffed me, and they were fine. Eventually, the others came around too and gave me a sniff and stopped barking.

After they were no longer all barking at me, I entered the temple area with a swarm of happy dogs following at my heels. It was incredibly cute. The temple's main feature was this chedi that overlooked the surrounding hills and mountains, and the mountain breeze blowing the Buddhist flags all around made for a beautiful scene.

My next stop was Mae Surin waterfall. On the way up, I found a cool viewpoint (though much of the view, as was very normal to me at this point, was obscured by smokiness).

The waterfall was incredibly tall. The natural landscape around here was just crazy, it really makes you wonder how it came to be that way.

I got to Pang Oung, which is actually just an agricultural reservoir with some forests around it, and booked my tent.

The nearby restaurants had just one restaurant that was still open, but thankfully it was good. I had tom yum soup which is similar to tom kha but without the coconut milk. It has lemon grass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves as well as some chile paste which gives it the color.

The next morning the smoke in the air was illuminated by the sun wihch looked pretty spooky and cool.

This view over the lake through the trees reminded me exactly of a camping spot I had last summer in Banff. Weird to experience deja vu across the world like that.

My destination for day 3 was Pai.

First, though, I stopped near Pang Oung, in Ban Rak Thai. It's an interesting town that was founded by Yunnanese immigrants from China. It has Chinese influence in its achitecture and cuisine, and I think many people there speak Chinese as well as Thai.

I stopped at a restaurant and found the owner to be one of the friendliest women ever. Her name was Da Li, and she was so fun to chat with. She cooked to Chinese dance music and I saved some good songs after Shazaming them.

I asked for her recommendation and she made me fresh tea leaf pork salad, from tea leaves she had picked that morning. The flavor of this dish was insanely good. I think it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Though ironically, I think the least spectacular part were the fresh tea leaves. I have no idea what else she put in there but it was so fresh and flavorful.

As I was eating and chatting with the owner, I once again had a conversation turn unexpectedly personal. Someone rode past on a motorbike and she told me that was the person her husband has been cheating on her with for the past two years. It was really really sad to hear about, but I'm not as concerned for her as I was for Sam An. She was clearly upset about it, but she was also one of the strongest, most independent and spunkiest people I've met.

After our deep conversation, she also made a free bowl of ma lod for me, a fruit that looks like a cherry tomato but tastes like a tomato mixed with rhubarb mixed with strawberry. It goes well with a spicy seasoning mixture made of sugar, salt, and chile flakes.

Ban Rak Thai is on the border with Myanmar (which it turns out is pronounced Myanmah), so of course I visited the border crossing.

My next stop was Ban Ja Bo, a mountain village with _insane_ views. I had Thai tea and cookies at a little cafe with the most spectacular deck/patio/eating area I've ever seen.

I did a steep mini-hike up to a viewpoint to really soak in what Ban Ja Bo had to offer.

My last stop before Pai was a little noodle shop atop a mountain pass, where I had Khanom Jin noodles. They're fresh rice noodles, and in this particular dish it was in a noodle soup, though I don't think that's always how it's served. 

![Mountain pass Khanom Jin noodles](/blog/images/2023-03-26_khanomjin.jpg)

At this mountain pass I ran into the Israeli guy I had met at the sticky waterfall a few days earlier. We basically just said hi before he continued with a group of people he had met. I stayed and ate my noodles and chatted with two Thai park rangers/soldiers who were guarding the entrance to a nearby park. They gave me a green orange and we discussed how the English words for the fruit and the color are the same. They taught me some words for colors in Thai, but I've forgotten them...

From here, I was almost in Pai. Technically, the Mae Hong Son loop continues after Pai back to Chiang Mai, but I spent a lot of time in Pai so I think it deserves its own blog post.
