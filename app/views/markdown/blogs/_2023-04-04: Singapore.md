My original plan was to spend at least two nights in Singapore, but taking Thailand at a pace that felt good left me with just 12 hours in Singapore. I actually would have cut it from my trip altogether with plans to give it a proper visit in the future at some point, but my flight from Singapore to Japan was non-changeable.

So in my 12 hours in Singapore, my biggest priority was to get a sense of the food. Straight out of the airport, I made a beeline for one of the hawker centers. This was made incredibly easy by the insanely good public transit. I went to the Old Airport Road Food Centre. It was a bit overwhelming just because there were so many options to choose from. And unlike the night markets of Asia I'd become used to, getting one item from any stall was a whole meal, instead of a small portion, meaning you can only really choose one, instead of being able to try a bunch.

Generally, the recommendation I've heard with hawker centers is to go to the stall with the longest line, because the locals know best. I was here at an off peak time, I think, so there weren't many lines anywhere to be found. But! I found one with these Michelin stickers plastered all over the front of it so I went with that one. I think Singapore is the easiest place in the world to get Michelin star food because these tiny hawker stalls can get them. I don't know if these stickers meant they had a Michelin _star_ exactly, but it was clearly some form of endorsement.

Most hawker stalls don't really have a menu... there are usually at most 4 choices, and often only one. At this stall I chose between white noodles and black noodles, and I think large or small size. I went with the black noodles, and they looked like this.

Not the most spectacular presentation, but _wow_ it was tasty. It must also be one of the only places where your Michelin recommended food comes on paper dishware. It's a common trend throughout Asia, I think, to care much more about flavor than presentation. I wholeheartedly support this order of priorities... after all, we eat with our mouths not our eyes.

After lunch, I joined hoards of schoolchildren getting out of school in the MRT. I was headed for the Botanic Gardens, a recommendation from someone I met... but I don't remember who. If whoever recommended it to me is out there reading this (though I doubt it), let me know and I'll credit you.

It was a very pleasant experience, though looking back at the videos I'm noticing how loud the insects were. They didn't really bother me at the time. Singapore's heat and humidity were really accentuated, though, and I found myself really trying to stay in the shade. There was a cool walkthrough of their seed bank laboratory where I learned how they prepare seeds for preservation. The seed bank is one of only a handful in the world, and the goal is to preserve global biodiversity in the case of plant extinctions (which is not an outlandish thing to prepare for... the world's seed banks already have the last genetic material of many plants that have otherwise gone extinct).

The garden also has an incredible orchid garden within it, which would have been worth a visit on its own.

After leaving the garden, I was really struck by how nice their MRT is... I wish we had metro entrances like this in DC.

The system is also just so extensive... it's rivaled only by Tokyo and maybe NYC in my experience. Though it beats NYC by miles in the cleanliness department.

My next stop was another hawker center, Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown, this time. It was nearing dinner time, so I was able to follow the advice of the lines. Unfortunately this also meant... waiting in line for a long time (duh) and having a hard time finding a table once I got my food.

I was a bit skeptical of the chicken coming out of this place because it looked extremely bland. It was the palest chicken I've ever seen. But this was the line for it so I trusted the locals. In case you can't see it, the stall sells Hainanese chicken rice.

Aaaaaand the wait was worth it. It was the most moist, tender chicken I've had in my life. On its own it wasn't the most flavorful, but it's not really meant to be eaten without the sauces, which provided all the flavor you needed. It's hard to put into words how good it was.

After dinner I hopped back on the MRT over to Gardens by the Bay, which is home to the iconic Marina Bay building. Sadly I only have this mediocre picture from right after I got out from the station.

This is the structure that houses the Cloud Forest, which I think is like an immersive greenhouse botanical garden experience, but tickets were like $45 which felt a bit steep, especially after I was just at the Botanic Garden proper. It was cool to look at from the outside though.

And coincidentally, not going into the Cloud Forest meant I was just in time to see the light show at Supertree Grove.

When this ended, I started on an ultimately failed quest to go to a bar in the city. I was getting close to when I needed to be back at the airport so it was a bit rushed. First I tried to get to the rooftop bar at Marina Bay (the top of the boat building pictured earlier). I felt incredibly under-dressed in my wrinkled backpacking clothes, because it's a very high end hotel. Theoretically there's no dress code, though, so I pressed on. Finding the entrance was a bit difficult on foot from the Supertree Grove, I think it's mostly the kind of place people take a cab to and from. By the time I got there, not only was it almost closed, but it was also fully reserved (they have a reservation system for getting up there since it's a popular place).

So, I accepted defeat and moved on to the other bar I wanted to go to, Long Bar at Raffles Hotel. My cab pulled up to the white gravel driveway and my door was opened for me by a man dressed in a crisp white uniform and a turban who politely asked how he could help me. Once again, I felt _super_ underdressed and generally outclassed. I didn't realize it was a 5-star hotel (made even fancier by the fact that it's in one of the wealthiest cities in the world). But he was very kind and pointed me in the direction of the bar.

My goal here was to get a Singapore Sling (recommended by Nana), and Long Bar was the place where it was created. Sadly, I got to the bar and there was a huge line to get in. It was getting dangerously close to when I needed to be at the airport, so I would have to accept defeat once more.

The airport is a destination in and of itself in Singapore. It's basically a mall, but also has this awesome indoor garden and _waterfall_.

There was also a train that reminded me of the evil lair from The Incredibles.

Finally, I was at least able to try a Singapore Sling at a sports bar in the airport. It's a bit fruity for my taste, but it was good.

Wow. Busy 12 hours, huh?

Next: back to Japan!
