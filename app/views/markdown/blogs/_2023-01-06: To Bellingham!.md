This morning I got up early to get on the train from Seattle up to Bellingham! The Bellingham Amtrak station was closed due to short-staffing so I had to carry on all my luggage (snowboard and all). I chose the good side of the train to ride on (see below). It really was a beautiful ride.

Grandpa picked me up from the train station. When we returned to his house we saw some bucks dueling in the back yard.

This weekend I'm going to Cypress Mountain in Vancouver for snowboarding! I'll be staying with Dave and Chris tonight and in a Vancouver hotel with Grace and her roommates Saturday night. Can't wait!
