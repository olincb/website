So… I always knew it was a possibility but I never thought it would happen to me.

Last night I was on the train from Ayutthaya to Pak Chong, with hopes of seeing Khao Yai National Park today. The trains aren’t quite up to western standards, so despite choosing 2nd class (the nicer option) there is no A/C. Even at night it’s been quite hot here so the train windows were all open.

Hoping to catch a nicer breeze, I reached my arm out the window. I knew it was probably a bad idea but it was just so hot. I guess I reached a bit too far out, because along came a signpost or something and it took my arm with it.

I don’t think this was their first dismemberment because the train staff knew just what to do. They were prompt with first aid and the ambulance was waiting for me at the next station.

Next thing I knew, I was back in Bangkok at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Actually it’s surprisingly nice, I think I’m in good hands here.

It didn’t hurt at first, but after the shock started wearing off, I think that was when I passed out. The painkillers are doing a pretty good job now but I’m really not looking forward to being weaned off.

Luckily my flight to Singapore (and then to Japan) isn’t until the 4th so I think I should be good to go by then. I wonder if I can get a discount for having one fewer limb than the typical passenger…

... April fools! Everything is going swimmingly :)
