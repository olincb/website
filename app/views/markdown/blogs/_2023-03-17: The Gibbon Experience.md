The Gibbon Experience is a conservation-focused ecotourism project that was started in the early 2000s by a french guy. The project, in partnership with the Lao government, protected a huge amount of jungle as a “national biodiversity conservation area” and employs locals as guides, park rangers, and other positions. They do significant work to prevent poaching and to confiscate illegal hunting weapons.

As for the ecotourism part, groups are led on multi-day excursions through the jungle, with hiking, ziplining, and if they’re lucky, gibbon sightings.

This was the highlight of my entire trip.

I feel obliged to share pretty much every food photo I have, so here is my breakfast from my hostel, before starting the Gibbon Experience (even though it’s not strictly on topic for this post). It was a crispy rice pancake which was delicious and incredibly filling.

The person working at my hostel said something I thought was funny. I think they know Huay Xai isn’t much of a destination town because I got there the night before and was asked “tomorrow are you going on the slow boat, the Gibbon Experience, or taking a bus to Thailand?”

## Day 1

After checking in at the Gibbon Experience office and watching a safety video, we were picked up in a tuk tuk where the pickup truck was far nicer than the usual ones in Laos. We drove a couple hours, then took a turn off the road and it immediately became apparent why they invested in a nicer truck.

The next hour-ish was serious off-roading across streams, up super steep dusty hills, over rocks, etc. Our conversation in the back of the truck stopped for this part because there was dust everywhere and you couldn’t get a sentence out without getting interrupted by a huge bump or jostle.

We arrived at a village, and ate lunch in a big dome structure which was apparently made out of wood from an illegally felled tree which was confiscated from loggers before they were able to take it out of the park (can’t put the tree back in the ground so might as well use it).

I think the noodles were sort of like rad na? Or maybe pad se ew? I’m not totally sure but I enjoyed it.

From here we continued on foot, the real start of the adventure. We were led by Saen-Aiy (pronounced “sen eye”), who exclusively wore pink rubber slides the whole trip, even hiking through the jungle.

![Starting off down the dirt road](/blog/images/2023-03-17_dirtroad.jpg)

We had a group of 6 (Bekah, Ditte, Lasse, Georgie, Kassie, and myself), as well as a group of 2 (Ian and Margaret) who were with us at the beginning and end but were staying in the honeymoon suite and got private tours (turned out they were not married, but just wanted the privacy). I really liked everyone in our group. Although that’s not entirely surprising because I think this sort of thing is self-selecting for people who are likely to be into similar things.

The dirt road, though far from major civilization, still felt pretty normal. But 30 seconds after we turned off the road onto a trail, it felt like we were REALLY out there in the middle of nowhere, with trees and vines as far as you could see (which wasn’t far), and just the sounds of our footsteps, dozens of birds, and about a million insects.

After a solid trek into the jungle, we put on the harnesses we had been given and got our feet wet by trying out the baby test zipline which was probably 20-30 feet long.

Another short trek brought us to our first real zipline.

![Typical zipline](/blog/images/2023-03-17_zipline.jpg)

The rest of the afternoon was just alternating trekking and ziplining, which was so much fun.

They were very big ziplines. To the point where you couldn’t see the end or hear the person on the other side. So to signal it is safe to go, each person bangs the line three times with their hand, and a few seconds later the signal reaches the other end of the wire, rattling the trolley of the next person.

I’ve been on ziplines before, but none that I have been on have come close to how crazy awesome these were. Hundreds of meters long and with views out over the jungle for miles and miles. It’s hard to explain just how insane it was. There’s a short clip in the video I’ll put at the end of the post, of Ditte taking a video as she was ziplining, but still it doesn’t do it justice.

Some ziplines, we were told, took what would be a three hour trek on foot through a valley, into a trip less than a minute long.

Eventually we made it to our treehouse, which was also accessed by zipline.

The treehouse we stayed in was named Khisi (not totally sure why it had a name, because they called it treehouse 4 most of the time). It was 45m above the ground, had 2 levels, including a bathroom with a shower, and a kitchen. Here’s the view.

The first thing we did when we got there was an emergency evacuation drill which of course makes you feel safer even if you’ll never have to do it.

After the drill, we had some snacks; notably some very yummy crackers with jelly inside, and these pears with a very strange texture. It tasted like a pear but felt like a mix between a pear and a watermelon.

The rest of the evening we just settled ourselves in and relaxed. 

![Me on the lower level of the tree house](/blog/images/2023-03-17_meintree.jpg)

Dinner was in the classic “rice and a bunch of stuff that everyone shares” style. I really liked the mushrooms.

![Dinner in the treehouse](/blog/images/2023-03-17_dinner.jpg)

We watched the sun set behind the smoke and went to bed, ready for a full day the next day.

![Smoky sunset](/blog/images/2023-03-17_sunset1.jpg)

Except mother nature wasn’t ready for bed…
I woke up to the sound of multiple people freaking out, frequent thunder claps, and the realization that the floor beneath me was swaying _quite_ a bit.

I had chosen the bed that was protected from the wind and rain by the trunk of the tree, but by the time I woke up, Ditte and Lasse’s bed was already drenched from the rain. We frantically read a safety pamphlet about whether to evacuate “don’t panic…” “your tree was chosen specifically for its strength…” “it’s been here for hundreds of years…” “your guide will come get you if evacuation is necessary…” “sometimes you may have to decide to evacuate on your own…”

Lasse (who later I found out had been stressed about the storm for hours as it had approached) made the decision that it was time to start evacuation. My groggy brain thought this was a bit of an over reaction, but I was snapped right out of it when I got downstairs to see our guides Khamla and Saen-Aiy there already, helping people into their harnesses to evacuate.

On the ground, we all huddled into the hut that our guides were staying in, and they brought their extinguished fire inside and miraculously restarted it. 

Shortly after getting down there, Lasse remembered that his and Ditte’s passports were in a bag up there, at risk of being swept away by the wind (I think the rest of us brought our bags with us or left everything valuable at the office before we left). So he and Khamla went on a quick rescue mission for the bag. I was sure I had seen this in a movie, and that they were going to die up there. But they made it back down safely.

We learned from Khamla as we waited out the storm that the danger in a storm like this wasn’t from the tree falling (despite the serious swaying we felt), but from branches falling through the roof, or lightning strikes.

I think Khamla deserves some sort of award or certificate for meteorology, because he was seriously able to predict things. He periodically checked the weather outside and predicted perfectly when it would stop.

After about an hour and a half, Khamla deemed it safe to return to the treehouse, so we did. We brushed the debris off our beds and made it through the rest of the night without incident.

## Day 2

The mist and fog the next morning were crazy.

We had a slow morning which I think everyone was fine with given the excitement in the middle of the night.

![Same chat, different angle](/blog/images/2023-03-17_treehousebrekky2.jpg)

Weather man Khamla told us to expect some more rain that day, but either luck or his insane skills as a guide had us sheltered every time it rained.

We trekked and ziplined to the biggest treehouse, and as soon as we got there it started raining. It had 3 floors, with little staircases between them.

We spent a long while there gazing out into the jungle, watching for wildlife (just bird sightings).

Here’s our crew! Left to right, Ditte, Bekah, Kassie, Georgie, me, Lasse.

I’m glad I brought my binoculars for this, it greatly improved the bird watching experience. Lasse and I worked together to take some photos and videos of this gorgeous bird through the binoculars.

When the rain stopped, we returned to our treehouse for lunch and a siesta. Post-siesta, we were back on the trail, on the way to check out some very large trees.

I wish I had included something for scale in this photo, but the roots of this tree were massive. It was particularly strange because the trunk itself wasn’t too wide, maybe just a meter across. It looked a bit like a rocket with very large fins. We learned that it does this to support itself because the soil in the jungle isn’t very deep before running into rock (due to the large amounts of rain that erode the topsoil).

![Very wide roots](/blog/images/2023-03-17_rocketree.jpg)

With a bit of the smoke cleared out by the rain from the previous night, we caught a very pretty sunset back from the treehouse.

## Day 3

On our final morning, we set out while it was still dark to try to see (and hear) some gibbons. We made it to a particular platform where our guides said it was common to see gibbons, just as it got light. We waited there quietly.

Our guides pointed out movement in the trees across a small valley. The gibbons! At first they were just hanging around in the trees but eventually they started singing.

A couple times per week, just before the sun comes up, the gibbons will call to each other to reunite their families, who sleep in different trees. We were quite lucky to be able to hear it.

To call it singing, though, is a bit generous in my opinion. It was the most otherworldly noise I think I’ve ever heard. It sounded like a battle from Star Wars, with laser guns and droids making beeping noises.

They continued for about 15 minutes, which was also lucky for us because typically it only lasts around 5 minutes. Khamla hypothesized that it was because they were happy to see everyone after the storm. But as with many of the things he said, I couldn’t really tell if it was a joke. He had a cheeky little smile that was very hard to read.

We returned to our treehouse for breakfast, and then spent the rest of the morning doing laps on ziplines (very fun).

![Me on a zipline](/blog/images/2023-03-17_zipliner.jpg)

This is Georgie and me. We didn’t know it yet but we became very good friends and ended up traveling together for a pretty long time.

![Georgie and I take a selfie with Bekah’s camera](/blog/images/2023-03-17_georgieselfie.jpg)

Khamla showed us a kind of berry that local women would sometimes use as lipstick.

![Khamla and I put on berry lipstick](/blog/images/2023-03-17_khamlalipstick.jpg)

All too soon, we started our trek out, returned to the village, had lunch under the dome, and were getting back into the pickup truck for the way back to Huay Xai.

![The whole crew!](/blog/images/2023-03-17_everyone.jpg)

Over the three days, we averaged 5.8 miles of hiking per day, and 1,290 ft of elevation gain per day.

My original plan was to stay a night in Huay Xai and figure out how to get to Thailand the next day, but a group of people from our crew were already planning on going that afternoon. So I canceled my stay at the hostel, and booked the same trip across the border with them. This was the point in my trip where things got quite a bit more spontaneous, and I loved it.

Next: Chiang Rai.
