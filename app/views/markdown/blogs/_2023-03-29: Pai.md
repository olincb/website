Pai is weird. It has a reputation for being a backpacker's party town (which is true) and a reputation for attracting a very hippie crowd (which is also true). I wasn't expecting to like it much, especially because I'm not really into partying. What it doesn't have a reputation for (one people talk about, anyway) is incredible natural beauty surrounding it... but that's what made me love it.

I say it's weird because it is very cool... but it doesn't feel like Thailand. It felt like there were more backpackers and ex-pats than Thai people. It's like its own separate, but still cool, place.

Anyway, when I got to Pai I went up to Pai's big Buddha to watch the sunset.

The sunset was crazy, but not necessarily in a breathtakingly beautiful way. The air pollution here was almost the worst in the world at the time (second only to Chiang Rai, I think). As the sun lowered it turned into a red dot you could look right at. Eventually, it became partially obscured by a mountain which you couldn't even see through the smoke/smog, before setting in a location that appeared to be well above where the horizon should have been.

Up at the Buddha I saw two people which I kept seeing around Pai, though I never spoke to them, which I wish I had.

I left my scooter at my hostel and walked into town. I think drunk scootering accidents are an unfortunately common way for tourists to get injured so I didn't want to mess with that.

There are a LOT of vegan restaurants in Pai (I think to accommodate the aforementioned hippie crowd). When food is cheap and it's equally as delicious as the rest of the cuisine, there's no reason not to eat vegan though, so many of my meals were vegan in Pai. Starting with this vegan pad se ew. I think it looks like a smaller portion than it was because the plate was huge...

One of my favorite Pai night-life activities was the Jazz House. I don't think I heard much jazz there, but they had live music (of various genres) and an awesome atmosphere every night. I guess I was just living life and enjoying the moment, because I have no photos or videos of it.

Another Pai night life activity was this juice/tea/kombucha bar with a cozy interior any no seats or tables other than pillows on the ground. There were instruments to go around, and people had made a music circle with drums and a xylophone and humming and singing. It was a very pleasant place to just chill for the rest of the night.

The next morning, the smoke/smog was at it again... There was a field across from my hostel, and you could barely see the other side of it.

The sun barely cut through the haze too.

I decided to lean into the Pai vibe a bit and found a yoga studio. Luckily there was a beginner yoga lesson that day which was perfect. I had an awesome instructor named Prie. I later found out he was only in Pai temporarily, and is from the south of Thailand, if I remember correctly.

After yoga, some more vegan Thai food. This pad thai was really unique, the sauce was almost like a soup. It's making me hungry thinking about it now, it was so good.

I scooted out to Pai canyon, which is a kind of surprisingly deserty area with... you guessed it, a huge canyon. I decided to hike down into the canyon without much of a plan other than a route on AllTrails with mediocre reviews.

Once in the canyon, the "trails" were just dry creekbeds. I decided to do some improvising and left the route and the trails altoghether. Eventually my bushwhacking led me around to the other side of the canyon area, and I met back up with a trail to complete a little loop. Most of my documentation was in videos which I edited together, I'd highly recommend a watch.

I _really_ liked this area, it was so gorgeous and so much fun to hike around. The views of the canyon walls from below and of the forest from atop the canyon walls were just breathtaking.

Near the end of my hike I found a hammock so I hung out there for like 45 minutes just enjoying the view and the warm sun before finishing the loop.

After my hike, I stayed near the more heavily trafficked entrance/viewpoint to watch the sun set.

I was recommended miang kham by Caoimhe (one of the Irish girls from Chiang Rai), who had just been in Pai a few days prior. It was easy to find in Pai's night market, and it was SO flavorful. I'm not quite sure what's in it (a google away, I'm sure...) but it was like a little bomb of flavor.

I pretty much just repeated the previous night's and the following morning's activities twice more. Jazz House for live music, the hippie cafe for some herbal tea and chilling, and then yoga in the morning.

This time, yoga was slightly more advanced, but still very doable and fun.

After yoga, I went accomodation shopping. I had only booked two nights in Pai, but I decided I wanted to stay another night. So I walked to a hostel that looked cool and was nicely located and asked if they had a free bed. They did.

For lunch I had an interesting Thai food twist... khao soi salad. I only got it because there was no real khao soi on the menu at the cafe I was at, but I'm glad because it was cool. It was one of those things where you're not quite sure how to begin to eat it though...

After fueling up I went on a pretty long, 10ish mile out and back hike to a waterfall called Mae Yen. The trail crossed the stream 38 times in each direction (I counted). I was very glad to be wearing my sandals.

There were a TON of bees and flies near the waterfall which were annoying me quite a bit so I only stayed long enough to go for a short swim and take some videos.

On the hike, I almost passed two guys hiking together. _Almost_, because a passing greeting turned into a conversation that lasted the rest of the way back to the trailhead and our scooters.

They were Alessandro and Dominic, from Italy and Switzerland, respectively. As I've mentioned before, I think you have a pretty good chance of meeting people you like when you're doing things you like to do; this was very much the case here. After our hike concluded we made plans to meet back up for dinner.

Dominic had a slightly more challenging time with the trail's 38 stream crossings as he didn't have sandals. So when we met back up in town, we found some sandals for him before dinner.

We all had pad thai from a food truck. It was a cool truck with one guy and one wok, so we had to wait a bit for our food. We all ordered the same thing so he could cook it in one batch. There were no beverages available, but he was parked across from a convenience store which had a wide selection of beef for Thai standards (it had two beers which weren't lagers!).

After dinner, Alessandro suggested the Chetz house. It took me a long time to realize he was saying Jazz House. Apparently the two of them had recognized me from the previous night at the Jazz House, but I did not remember seeing them. In any case, that's where we spent the evening (for the third night in a row, for me).

The next morning, I had some pad kra pow with tofu for breakfast. I really fell in love with spicy, rice-based breakfasts, it was just such a hearty meal and the spice was so good to help wake up. Those things that look like potatoes are chunks of fried tofu.

I went to the same yoga studio for the third morning in a row, but sadly Prie wasn't there. This time the yoga was incredibly physically challenging, but it felt amazing.

My last Pai activity was the Mo Pang waterfall. I only got this mediocre video of one of the less popular tiers of the waterfall.

It's known as the waterslide waterfall because you can slide down it. After watching some local kids for a bit, I discovered you're supposed to first jump in one of the pools to get wet, then you take a bucket that's on a rope, and splash water down one particularly smooth section. Then you just get a bit of a running start and jump onto your butt, and you slide down about 20 feet into the next pool down. It was so much fun. I wanted to take some more videos but it felt a bit too weird to film strangers and children so I didn't.

The local kids were crazy. They were jumping off cliffs like 25 feet high into pools that were no more than 5 feet deep, pushing and pulling each other around on the slippery rocks near the pools, and shoving each other into the water. They were having an amazing time.

After the waterfall, I had to make a beeline back to Chiang Mai. Alessandro and Dominic were planning on catching a train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and I wanted to make the same train.

I'm not sure beeline is the right word though, because this last segment of the Mae Hong Son loop was particularly windy. There are over 700 back to back curves through the mountains between Pai and Chiang Mai. It was incredibly fun on the scooter.

I returned the scooter to the rental place in Chiang Mai and only had to pay for 1 extra day of renting it (I miscounted and was expecting to have to pay for 2 extra days). I made the train by like 5 minutes, but sadly didn't get a very good dinner.

Next time: I hang out with Alessandro and Dominic in Ayutthaya.
