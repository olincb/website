I had a measly 9 days in Vietnam… which I can now say for sure is not long enough to experience Vietnam. I sadly had to skip out on 3 different day- or multi-day trips that I really would have loved to do, and generally felt a bit rushed.

I started in Saigon and traveled north and finished in Hanoi.

I definitely overestimated my ability to pack in a day full of activities on the day I got to Saigon, especially after a meager 3ish hours of sleep…

## Saigon proper

Flying in over the Mekong river was pretty cool.

I am surprised to say it but I think these spring rolls from a shop just outside the airport were the best I had anywhere in Vietnam…

My first and most lasting impression of the city was how insanely chaotic it was. There were thousands of motor bikes on every street, moving like schools of fish. Crossing the road is an art form, because people on the road don’t stop. You just walk out slowly and predictably and the sea of bikes parts around you. It was stressful at first but later became quite natural.

After getting to the hostel, the most important thing was more food, so I found a spot for some banh mi. If you’re unfamiliar, banh mi is a Vietnamese sandwich on french bread, usually with vegetables, sliced sausage and pate. This was the first of _many_ that I had in Vietnam. I love restaurants and food stalls that sell only one thing. I got there and instead of “What would you like?” it was “How many?”

Saigon (and all the cities I visited in Vietnam) has interesting evidence of french colonialism in its architecture, like their post office:

And their (currently under construction) Notre Dame Cathedral:

I walked around the outside of the Saigon Independence Palace, but didn’t go in. With more time I would have liked to go in, there’s apparently a cool museum in there.

After walking around those landmarks, I went shopping at Ben Thanh market and haggled for a fake North Face fanny pack and a light buttoned shirt I’ve been wearing pretty much nonstop since. The market was crazy chaotic, and you couldn’t take three steps without being called over by a merchant. “Hello sir, want to buy a shirt?” or a bag or shorts or a jacket or a smoothie or grilled meat or pretty much anything.

I met up with George and Ann (who I met in Taiwan) for dinner, drinks, and some strolling around. Dinner with someone who speaks the language and knows what to get (Ann) at a local restaurant is just so nice. It was really fun to catch up with them again, I’m hoping it’s not the last I see of them.

That night I hastily booked a tour of the Mekong Delta for the next day at the first travel agency that was still open.

## Mekong Delta

The Mekong is a very long river that flows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Where it fans out to meet the sea is the Mekong Delta, and there are tons of islands and tiny waterways which we explored on this tour.

It felt a bit like a tourist trap at times, but we saw and tried some fun things, like this coconut candy they were making and selling.

I bought a really good coconut popsicle there at our first stop.

We got on a number of different small boats to go through the creeks and streams.

There was also a stop where we hopped on rusty old bicycles for a side trip before lunch. We had chicken, rice, veggies (cabbage mostly), and spring rolls, and it was decent. Can’t complain when it’s included in a pretty inexpensive tour.

At one stop, we were given some amazing fruit and we listened to some people singing and playing guitar.

I tried this new fruit called Longan or Dragon’s Eye, which was similar to rambutan or lychee.

Overall I enjoyed myself a lot, but I can understand some people’s opinion that the feeling of being tourist trapped and just being led from one place-to-spend-money to the next makes it not worth it. I was very glad I did it though.

With more time in Saigon, I would have loved to see the Cu Chi tunnels, where the Viet Cong hid from American soldiers in the Vietnam war (they call it the American war).

Alas, I had to catch the night train to Da Nang that evening. This was my bunk:

The next day, from Da Nang, I caught a taxi to Hoi An.
