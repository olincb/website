Grace and I spent our last 2 days and 1 night together in Taipei. 

We decided to take advantage of the exceptionally cheap massages in Taipei and had a very relaxing afternoon. 

After many budget hotels and hostels, we splurged on our last night for a 5-star hotel in Taipei, the Shangri-La Far Eastern. Compared to 5-star hotels in the rest of the world, it was quite a good deal as well actually…

We had a lazy morning which included a visit to the rooftop pool before checking out around noon.

We spent our last day exploring some fun areas of the city. Before we left for the airport, we went to one last night market for dinner. It ended up taking longer than expected so we needed to take an Uber to the airport rather than the train, but I think it was worth it for the extra time at the market.

After a _VERY_ fun week and a half together in Taiwan, we had to say goodbye.

Grace’s flight was on the 28th, but mine was the next morning so I stayed at a hostel next to the airport.
