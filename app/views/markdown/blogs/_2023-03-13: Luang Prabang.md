Luang Prabang was my first stop in Laos. A fun fact about Laos is that everyone in SE Asia calls it Lao. Laos is literally the plural form, and the French called it that after uniting several Lao groups of people in a single colony. Another fun fact is only one of those groups were actually called Lao people, and the names and cultures of the others were pretty much ignored by the colonists.

Anyway, enough with the fun facts, and onto the very unfun facts… After I got to my hostel, I realized I had left my phone in the taxi from the airport. This was a very very stressful introduction to a new country where you don’t know how to get around and you don’t speak the language.

I hired a tuk tuk back to the airport to try to find the taxi service but the airport was closed because my flight was the last one.

Looking back, I was probably more freaked out than I needed to be… after all, people used to travel without phones all the time, and I still had my passport and wallet.

This was where I experienced the genuine kindness of Lao people for the first time. The tuk tuk driver placed some calls, and we drove to his friend‘s house, who works for the taxi company. I won’t lie, I was a bit concerned I was about to get kidnapped, but I had nothing to worry about. He placed another call on my behalf and reached my original taxi driver, who had my phone! He said he would drop it at my hostel the next day.

The next morning, the taxi driver came to the hostel with my phone. But he didn’t know my name so they didn’t know who to retrieve. I was just obliviously hanging out in my dorm room as he waited for *three hours* at the lobby. Again, I cannot believe the kindness of Lao people. Eventually, he gave it back to the tuk tuk driver from the night before since he knew what I looked like. I ended up getting it back from him later that day.

With phone back in hand I was ready for the town. First stop: food. Lao food seemed pretty much like Thai food but a little different. I had basil rice first, which is also a Thai classic. Also, I think BeerLao is my favorite brewery in all of SE Asia. They have a dark lager and an IPA in addition to the lager that tastes pretty similar to all the other SE Asian lagers.

I strolled around town for a bit. Luang Prabang was quite pleasant. It mostly sits between the Nam Khan River and the Mekong River.

There’s a steep, tall hill almost right in the middle of town, with a temple at the top. From the top of Phousi Hill you get pretty much a 360° view of the town and surrounding mountains. Sadly the skyline was hiding behind a blanket of smoke (as I’ve mentioned, I’m here in the burning season).

That night I went to the night market for dinner.

A local specialty is Luang Prabang sausage. Honestly there wasn’t much special about it, but it was good. Though… I don’t really know what they put in there, I could have been eating anything really.

I had my first mango sticky rice of my trip. I think it may be my favorite dessert (ever).

I also saw my first chingchok lizard that night. They’re also known as house geckos!

The next morning, I embarked on a full day tour of the sights around Luang Prabang, outside of the town itself. It was a busy day with an ambitious itinerary; very fun but I think ideally I works have seen all these things over two days instead of one.

Our first stop was a Hmong village. To be honest, I despised this part of the tour. It felt like we were shipped in to gawk and take photos of human beings living in poverty. A bit like a zoo for humans. I intentionally took no photos of anyone inside, other than a man who played an instrument for our group, who explicitly said we could take videos.

It felt vastly different to my experience with Hmong culture from Sa Pa in Vietnam. On the way out, I found that they were calling it a “Community Based Tourism Development Project” which sounds a lot to me like “Exploiting the Culture of Ethnic Minorities.”

Moving on from that lowlight, we visited a bear sanctuary where they house bears saved from poaching who will never be able to return to the wild. There was a lot of educational material on bear conservation in SE Asia. They had at least four Asian Black Bears that I saw, and possibly more in parts of their enclosure that was further off the path.

![Bears in a rehab center](/blog/images/2023-03-13_bears.JPG)

Next, we visited Khuang Si waterfall, which was spectacular. There were seven tiers, with the furthest-upstream one being the tallest.

![Me in front of Khuang Si waterfall](/blog/images/2023-03-13_waterfall.JPG)

You could swim in certain levels, which plenty of people were taking advantage of. I did a little hike to the top of the waterfall where there was another, far less crowded swimming area. This was one part of the tour where I would have liked to spend much more time.

Next, we went to an elephant “sanctuary” where we had lunch and could feed elephants. There are definitely worse ways to see elephants (some places still allow riding them), but the assertion of being ethical is still a bit murky. Elephants are not naturally docile, so you have to wonder what kind of training they had to go through to let people touch them.

![Elephants that are okay with humans touching them](/blog/images/2023-03-13_sadelephant.JPG)

On the other hand, they could have been rescued from an abusive place, and these ones down by the river seemed to be living the good life.

![Elephants hanging out in the river](/blog/images/2023-03-13_happyelephants.JPG)

From there we boarded a long boat (I’ll describe these boats in more detail in my next post) and started up the Mekong River. Now and then there were hints of the unreal mountains that Laos has to offer, but for the most part they were obscured by smoke.

![Very cool mountain skyline but you can only barely see it through the smog](/blog/images/2023-03-13_mountains.JPG)

We stopped at “Whisky Village,” where Lao whisky (called Lao Lao) is their specialty. We sampled three kinds, two sweet ones and one very very strong one. It tastes a bit like very strong sake, which makes sense as it’s made from rice as well. 

![Whisky at the whisky village](/blog/images/2023-03-13_whiskey.JPG)

We arrived in Pak Ou (literally, mouth of the Ou, where the Nam Ou River flows into the Mekong River) and were greeted by cliffs of dizzying scale. They reminded me of the cliffs in Zion National Park, Utah.

![A massive cliff right next to the river](/blog/images/2023-03-13_cliff.JPG)

Opposite the confluence, there are two caves full of buddha images (statues) that local people have been leaving for years. One cave contains over 1000 buddhas, and the other contains over 3000.

![Shrines and buddha images inside Pak Ou cave](/blog/images/2023-03-13_cave.JPG)

There was a cool view from the mouth of the lower cave.

![A view from inside Pak Ou cave](/blog/images/2023-03-13_caveview.JPG)

The upper cave had some very cool cave drawings. I have no idea how old they are or anything about them really…

![A cave drawing inside Pak Ou cave](/blog/images/2023-03-13_cavedrawing.JPG)

We watched the sun set over the Mekong. The smoke gave the sun a bright red color that you could look right into (but probably shouldn’t anyway).

![Sunset on the Mekong](/blog/images/2023-03-13_sunset.JPG)

Here’s everyone from the tour, quite a crowd.

I made friends with Jasmine, Alex, and Ana so we all went to the night market after the tour for dinner. We explored the shopping area and found these hilarious handmade coin purses.

![Bags at the night market with funny quotes sewn on them](/blog/images/2023-03-13_funnybags.JPG)

I’ve not forgotten about requests to share mundane things too, but I only really feel comfortable taking pictures of the rooms if nobody else is in there. So dorm pictures have been few and far between.

![The hostel dorm](/blog/images/2023-03-13_dorm.JPG)

I was staying at the Mad Monkey, which is a chain of party hostels. It was the first party hostel I’ve been to, and I don’t really feel like I need to do it again. It was quite nice though… it had an outdoor restaurant and bar, as well as a pool. The bar was nice because on weekends there was a 30-minute open bar where you could get Lao Lao mixed drinks for free. It’s a bit of an acquired taste so I don’t think they lost too much money on it. 

Most of the people there made a habit of going bowling in the nights. The local bowling alley is just outside the city limits, so it stays open until 1 or 2 am, while everything inside the city is forced to close at 11pm. It sounds like it was quite a party… I don’t regret not going. To be honest I don’t really get the party backpacker mentality… I want to travel to experience a country, not to get wasted with a bunch of other tourists and sleep till noon the next day.

Moving on… One fun thing about SE Asia is the freedom to eat whatever kind of meal at whatever time of day. Omelets for dinner are common, and noodles or rice for breakfast are also common. Here is some pad se liu I had for breakfast. I think it’s like a Lao version of pad se ew; or it’s actually just pad se ew that was spelled weirdly on the menu. It’s hard to say because there’s so much overlap between Thai and Lao food, almost every cook makes every dish a bit differently, and the spellings of dishes in English on menus is incredibly non-standardized.

Here’s some cashew chicken I had for lunch. This is another dish shared with Thai food.

Luang Prabang is home to many Buddhist temples, but Wat Xiengthong is the most popular to visit. It was a complex with many gorgeous, ornately decorated buildings.

I visited the royal palace museum, which was interesting. Mostly it was kept as the palace originally looked, with some extra items put on display. Laos is no longer a kingdom, so they have no need for a palace any more (they’re now Lao PDR, or The Lao People’s Democratic Republic). Also I don’t think Luang Prabang was the capital when they had a king, so it may have been an ancillary palace. Anyway, there were no photos allowed inside so I only have this photo from the front doorstep.

![The view from the front of the royal palace](/blog/images/2023-03-13_royalpalacemuseum.JPG)

On my last night in Luang Prabang, I discovered the _real_ night market. There’s an alley shooting off perpendicular to the main night market where the locals seem to go.

![The real food spot for locals](/blog/images/2023-03-13_realnightmarket.JPG)

I started with dessert… They have many varieties of these coconut pancakes from tiny ones like these to big ones they have to fold up to give to you.

![Yummy mini coconut pancakes](/blog/images/2023-03-13_coconutpancakes.JPG)

My favorite food I had in Laos was Or Lam. Sadly the photo I took was about halfway through and it doesn’t look great. It’s a stew served with sticky rice, and similar to szechuan peppers, it has a tingly, mouth numbing effect. But unlike szechuan peppers, it’s not really that spicy at all. It gets this effect from Lao Chili Wood, which I don’t think is edible, but they leave it in the stew for flavoring. If I was back in Laos for a day, this would be the dish I would seek out. Sadly, I think it’s too niche of a dish to find in the US, especially because Lao restaurants don’t really exist, only Lao/Thai combination restaurants.

![Or Lam](/blog/images/2023-03-13_orlam.JPG)

At a convenience store, I found the best flavor of chips that exist, sweet basil lays. They’re also a bit spicy. Yet another thing that may be difficult to find in the US…

![Sweetbasil lays](/blog/images/2023-03-13_sweetbasillays.JPG)

On my last morning, I had to get up early to catch a boat, so I figured I might as well get up EXTRA early, and partake in the local tradition of morning alms. Each morning, Buddhist monks walk down the main street with large bowls hung over their shoulders. Locals and tourists buy sticky rice, crackers, cookies, and fruit, and put a bit in each monk’s bowl when they pass. It’s a cool tradition but I think many tourists didn’t do their homework about how to participate respectfully. You’re not supposed to take flash photography, nor stand in their way, nor even be standing up as they pass you (all of which was happening…).

![I’m ready to hand out alms](/blog/images/2023-03-13_alms1.JPG)

![Here come the monks](/blog/images/2023-03-13_alms2.JPG)

After the alms giving, I stopped by the morning market, which felt like a very genuine experience. I was someone’s first sale of the day, which is considered to be the luckiest purchase. The vendor swatted all her goods with the money I gave her to spread the good luck, which is standard practice for vendors in much of SE Asia.

![Produce at the morning market](/blog/images/2023-03-13_morningmarket.JPG)

I got everything I needed for my boat trip up the Mekong, including a different variation of the coconut pancake.

Next: the slow boat from Luang Prabang to Huay Xai.
