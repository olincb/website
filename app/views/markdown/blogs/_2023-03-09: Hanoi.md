I spent about half of my time in Vietnam in or around Hanoi, and I think that was a good choice. Not only are there a lot of trips to do from the city, I think it was also just a good city for hanging out. And, once again, I didn’t spend nearly enough time there. I really wanted to do a cruise to Bai Tu Long bay or Cat Ba island, but I simply did not have the time for it.

## First days in Hanoi

My hostel in Hanoi was right in the old quarter, which was super lively and full of backpackers and markets at all hours. There was store after store of the same set of knock off North Face/Patagonia/Adidas products at crazy cheap prices (even before haggling…) I asked one storekeeper if the items were genuine and he said “Yes all real!” with a big grin that was saying the opposite.

Bun cha for lunch was quite good, but as with most Vietnamese dishes with broth I wondered how such warming food is so common in such a hot place. You end up sweating even without the chilis…

It came with spring rolls, vermicelli noodles, meat and veggies in a broth, mint, lettuce and chilis. All of these get mixed together in the middle bowl right before eating.

I visited the Hanoi Military History Museum, but got there a bit late and didn’t see many of the exhibits about the American war (or the Vietnam war if you’re from the US). I did learn about Vietnam’s long history of resistance wars against various foreign rulers, particularly from China and later France.

Many of the planes and tanks on display were captured from the US during the American war.

That evening I saw a water puppet show, which is an art form that comes from rice farmers, who were entertaining each other in the knee-deep waters of their rice paddies. I enjoyed the music in particular.

I think I was the youngest person who was voluntarily there… there were a lot of retired travelers in the crowd.

Nearby, this bridge to a temple on an island in Hoan Kiem Lake caught my eye. They were charging for admission for foreigners and I thought I was getting a good enough experience from the outside so I didn’t go in.

Pho for dinner! I have come to realize that in Vietnam, the more the furniture at a restaurant looks like it is made for preschoolers, the more local/authentic/high quality it is. So here is my bowl of pho on a tiny plastic table as I sit on a tiny plastic chair out on the sidewalk. Looks like I couldn’t wait to start eating so the picture’s from about halfway through…

![I think this was pho](/blog/images/2023-03-09_pho.JPG)

A street food staple in Vietnam and honestly everywhere I’ve been in Asia is meat on a stick. The person before me got chili sauce by default but I had to ask for it… it wouldn’t be the last time a local assumed I don’t like spicy food.

This smoking ice cream was an interesting night market novelty but to be honest didn’t taste spectacular.

The next morning started with egg coffee, which is a Hanoi specialty. It was thick and rich and sweet and delicious. Usually I drink my coffee black but wow this was good.

![Egg coffee](/blog/images/2023-03-09_eggcoffee.JPG)

Another must-eat was cha ca, which was very similar to bun cha, but with fish instead of pork, much more dill, and a small amount of fish sauce in place of a large amount of broth. You cook it in a little wok on the table in front of you, which was fun. This was probably my most expensive meal in Vietnam, because I found a recommendation for a slightly higher end restaurant. Still very inexpensive by US standards, though.

I was never at the train street at the right time of day to watch a train go through, but it was a cool view nonetheless.

Vietnam’s long history leads to some interesting government buildings, like the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long. It was originally a walled city with a palace, and over time served many purposes, like a meeting place for the leaders of the communist party, and a bunker for war strategizing during the American war. Now, it’s a museum and archaeological site.

One great part of solo traveling is the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, even if that’s watching old men play Chinese chess in a park for an hour at a time. In the park I visited, there were crowds of them around each game, with everyone shouting and touching the board, arguing for the move they thought was best. Chess seems to be a team sport in Vietnam.

They didn’t seem to mind me just hanging around and watching, but sadly I had no input to give on what move to play. Even after some googling at a juice bar where I could get some WiFi and a lot of observing, I was pretty much only able to tell which pieces were which and how they could move about half the time.

I’m pretty sure gambling is illegal in Vietnam, but money discretely changed hands after every game…

I visited the temple of literature, which was cool, but I don’t have much to say about it. There are many many names carved in stone of people who graduated from higher philosophical and literary education.

![Me at the temple of literature](/blog/images/2023-03-09_templeofliterature.JPG)

I’m visiting SE Asia in the burning season, when farmers burn their fields in preparation for planting. That leads to wonderful vistas like this one over Ho Tay Lake:

![The sun cuts through the smog over Ho Tay Lake](/blog/images/2023-03-09_smoglake.JPG)

I went to Tran Quoc pagoda twice. The first time, I was wearing shorts which is inappropriate for entering temples so I stayed outside. The second time, I was equipped with pants but the doors were closed (not sure why). I took it as a sign that I was simply not meant to visit. Looks cool from the outside though.

Wandering back through the city towards my hostel, I found this super cute canal neighborhood.

![Colorful canal houses](/blog/images/2023-03-09_canal.JPG)

There’s nothing like accidentally finding something that looks really good to eat as you’re walking through a city. That’s how I found my dinner of steamed buns and dumplings that night.

![Steamed buns](/blog/images/2023-03-09_buns.JPG)

That evening, I boarded yet another night train, this time bound for Sa Pa.

## Trekking in Sa Pa

I booked a 2-day, 3-night trekking tour with a homestay. The first and last night are on the night train from and to Hanoi, and the middle night is with a H’mong family in their village. The H’mong are an ethnic group that span across the northern regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and parts of Myanmar. From what I can tell, much of their culture is distinct to much more local tribes.

I was with a Swiss couple, Linda and Oliver, who were so much fun to hang out with. We were blessed with an incredible guide named Shom which means bamboo in H’mong. Her English was incredible, and we were shocked to find out she learned it all just from guiding trekking tours for English speaking tourists.

Our trek started in heavy fog which made for some kind of spooky views. We started walking through farm fields, and continued on dirt roads, hiking trails, and paths that were somewhere in between a road and a trail.

![Started off trekking in heavy fog](/blog/images/2023-03-09_spookywall.JPG)

At first we were also joined by two more H’mong people who carried large baskets on their backs.

![Me and our initial trekking crew](/blog/images/2023-03-09_trekselfie.JPG)

Shom and the family we stayed with are from the Black H’mong tribe. They get the name from the distinctive black clothing they wear, which is dyed with indigo.

We made a stop to examine some indigo that was growing beside the path. I crushed it in my hand, and my hands were dyed blue-green for the next day and a half.

One of the women traveling with us for the first part made this little bamboo horse for me as we were hiking.

![A mini bamboo horse given to me as a gift](/blog/images/2023-03-09_gift.JPG)

We picked up some corn at a tiny market for a snack. It was so unlike corn I’m used to… Each kernel practically fell off the cob. You could pick them off with your hands instead of biting off the corn cob.

![Corn, on the cob](/blog/images/2023-03-09_corn.JPG)

Eventually the fog lifted a bit, allowing some really cool views of the terraced rice fields.

![Photo of me standing in front of rice paddies](/blog/images/2023-03-09_meandpaddies.JPG)

![Beautiful rice paddies](/blog/images/2023-03-09_scenicpaddies.JPG)

When we stopped for lunch, it was revealed that the basket on the two H’mong women’s backs contained scarves and bags for us to purchase. It was also made clear that they wouldn’t likely leave us until we each bought something. They were nice to us and made good company on the walk that morning, so I was fine with what otherwise would have felt a bit coerced… I got a scarf and a coin purse for like $15.

We had _more_ than enough food for three people for lunch, and it was quite yummy. I really liked the tofu with tomatoes (top left).

![Lunch spread on day 1](/blog/images/2023-03-09_trekkinglunch.JPG)

I wouldn’t have thought to buy a scarf but shortly I was glad I did. It was surprisingly chilly up in the mountains.

![My newly purchased scarf keeping me warm](/blog/images/2023-03-09_warmoutfit.JPG)

Seeing how people live in rural vietnam was eye opening to say the least. I think something like 77% of households in rural northern Vietnam are self sufficient with the food that they grow, so nobody appears to be going hungry, which is fortunate. But the buildings and general lifestyle are just so unlike anything I imagined. It felt a bit like stepping back in time.

The family we stayed with had what appeared to be a pretty average home for the area, with a few niceties that were added for their guests which most households wouldn’t have… like hot water and western style toilets.

This was their kitchen.

Shom showed us how to bite off and chew on sugar cane, which makes an excellent snack. (You spit it out once you chew all the juice out.)

![Sugar cane is an excellent snack](/blog/images/2023-03-09_sugarcane.JPG)

We also snacked on popcorn! Doesn’t look like the popcorn I’m used to, but I liked it more.

![Some real popcorn](/blog/images/2023-03-09_popcorn.JPG)

Here’s a rooster hanging out on the front porch.

![The front door of the homestay, and a chicken](/blog/images/2023-03-09_homestayfrontdoor.JPG)

Beside the house are some rice fields and in the back is their pig pen and chicken coop.

![Side yard/rice paddies and pig pen](/blog/images/2023-03-09_homestaysideyard.JPG)

We helped make dinner, which was so much fun. We had about a million things for dinner, including many kinds of vegetables and meats. Each person got their own bowl of rice and grabbed things from the center dishes. I asked if this was a typical dinner or a special one, and I wasn’t completely sure how to interpret the response. I think a typical dinner would have a similar format but with fewer options on any given night.

![Everyone except Shom at the dinner table](/blog/images/2023-03-09_homestaydinner.JPG)

The next morning, there was even less fog and we could see a bit more of the valley. Above the peak of one of the roofs on the right, you can see a waterfall we had walked past the day before. We were sad to hear that it had claimed the lives of two locals in the past few years, from people slipping down it. For obvious reasons we weren’t walking near it the previous day, just observing from the side.

![View from the front deck](/blog/images/2023-03-09_homestayview.JPG)

This is Oliver, Linda and me as we were walking through a bamboo forest.

![Oliver, Linda and me in the bamboo forest](/blog/images/2023-03-09_bamboo.JPG)

We chose to take a slightly more challenging route on the second day, which I’m glad we did because there were some pretty cool views of the valley.

![Me above a valley](/blog/images/2023-03-09_trailview.JPG)

Our day was shorter on the second day, and we finished hiking at lunchtime. Fried noodles at a restaurant, this time.

![Fried noodles for lunch after trekking](/blog/images/2023-03-09_lunch.JPG)

We managed to escape the gaze of someone peddling more scarves, bags, and purses as we ate.

We caught a ride back up to Sa Pa and dropped Shom off on the way. I will miss her but we’re keeping up by sending each other voice messages on WhatsApp (she can’t read or write English or Vietnamese).

Linda, Oliver and I relaxed at a coffee/juice bar in Sa Pa and had dinner before getting back on the night train.

This is a fun little compilation of all the videos I took on the trip.

## Last day in Hanoi

I had 1 final day in Hanoi because the night train arrived in the morning and my flight was in the evening. I said goodbye to Linda and Oliver, who were continuing on to take a cruise to Ha Long bay. I miss them too, I think we became pretty good friends after 2 days.

I don’t know if I chose a terrible day for it, or if it is always like this, but I queued among thousands of people, mostly schoolchildren on field trips, to see Ho Chi Minh. The wait may have been more fun than the main event actually; I think I got waved at and happily greeted by every single kid there. 

![Massive crowd of people waiting to see HCM](/blog/images/2023-03-09_hcmlines.JPG)

I waited in line for over an hour to see his perfectly preserved corpse for maybe 60 seconds. I didn’t take any photos inside because you’re not supposed to and I didn’t feel like arguing much with the dozens of crisply dressed communists with rifles.

![HCM’s mausoleum](/blog/images/2023-03-09_mausoleum.JPG)

I bought some banh mi and took it to this old bridge to eat it. The long walk to the center of the bridge was not really worth it… not sure how it made it onto a list of things to do in Hanoi that I found online. I ended up hailing a Grab (Asian Uber) scooter and riding back into town.

![An old French bridge](/blog/images/2023-03-09_bridge.JPG)

My airport food coming into the country in Saigon was amazing, but my airport food leaving from Hanoi was sadly a different story… My banh mi was little more than a hot dog. (Can you tell how much I like banh mi by the fact that i decided to eat it for two meals in a row?)

![Crappy banh mi from the airport](/blog/images/2023-03-09_airportbanhmi.JPG)

After 9 days in Vietnam, my flight would take me into Luang Prabang in Laos!

I really would love to come back to Vietnam some time. I would spend two weeks there at a bare minimum, but ideally longer. A friend I later met in Laos is now in Vietnam for a month and I am extremely jealous. Its chaotic cities and beautiful natural landscape were such good compliments to each other, and are just so fun to explore.
