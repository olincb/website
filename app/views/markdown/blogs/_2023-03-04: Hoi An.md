I originally thought I’d have two full days in Hoi An, but I arrived in the afternoon so it was more like 1.5 days… At first I wasn’t super pressed about it, since my list of things to do was:

- Beach

And I’m not much of a beach person anyway. On top of that, I think the beach is more stress than it’s worth when you’re solo traveling because if you want to go swimming you have to leave your stuff somewhere on the beach where anyone could steal it.

So anyway, I spent the first afternoon at the beach.

It turned out that Hoi An had much more than just its beach to offer. I really wanted to go to My Son, which are a group of ruins of Hindu temples, from a time when Hinduism was more common in Vietnam. Alas, that was a full-day tour and I didn’t have time for it.

The first night, I asked the hostel owner about local food, and he delivered with an excellent recommendation. Cao lau noodles are local to Hoi An, so they were a must-get.

This dish may have been one of my favorites in Vietnam.

I coincidentally discovered the Hoi An night market after dinner. They light up a bunch of lanterns on boats at the docks there, which is beautiful.

I saw a group of monks who appeared to be on their version of a field trip, which was interesting. I had never seen monks just doing regular activities before…

For dessert I got a banana pancake which felt appropriate as I’m roughly following the “banana pancake trail” through SE Asia.

The next morning, I returned to old town for the day. I discovered an amazing new fruit at the market there (someone with me at the Mekong delta tour recommended it to me so I had to try it of course). In Vietnamese, they’re called mang cau, and in English they’re sweetsops or sugar apples.

They taste like a combination of a coconut and a pear. _Super_ yummy!

Another market find was this banh bao, which had a hard boiled quail egg inside it.

After exploring the market some more I had my quang (my is pronounced mee), a noodle dish local to the central part of Vietnam. I liked this a lot but not as much as cao lau.

This Japanese covered bridge is an intriguing landmark in the old town, which stands as a testament to the diversity of the town over time. I was offered a photo shoot with a fruit vendor which I accepted and later realized made me obliged to buy a ridiculous amount of fruit… So I walked around with a large bag of rambutan, bananas, and oranges for the rest of the day.

Some of the buildings were preserved quite well. The architecture was super interesting, many of the buildings had little courtyards like this one.

Another Hoi An special are the white rose dumplings, which were pretty much just high quality but otherwise standard dumplings.

I learned how to make black sesame soup, and was offered some to try. It was sweet and thick and quite tasty. Essentially, the process is to grind black sesame seeds and a bunch of herbs and roots until it forms a liquid. Here are the official instructions from a sign there:

> First, black sesame is torrefied, then pounded. Sargasso, centella... are grinded down for getting its juice. The next steps are to make the syrup, to simmer Chinese herbs for getting their first extract. Finally, cook the mix including syrup, juice of sargasso, centella; then add sesame pounded powder, kudzu starch, sweet potato starch, first Chinese herbs extract. Stir the mix steadily until the sweet soup is ready to use.

Before going back to catch my ride back to Da Nang, I got one last bowl of cao lau.

As I was sitting in my cab from Hoi An to Da Nang, I reflected on Vietnamese driving and made a comprehensive list of driving rules in Vietnam. Here they are:

1. Don’t run into anyone who is _in front_ of you
2. Honk your horn to:  
    1. let people know you exist
    2. warn someone that they are moving into your path and you don’t plan on braking
    3. go around blind corners and through intersections at full speed

You may notice there is nothing about turn signals, staying in your lane, or stopping at red lights. Things like these are allowed but purely optional. Also note that there is no responsibility toward those behind you. Mirrors on motor bikes I’m pretty sure are purely decorative.

At the train station I bought these interesting chewy sesame and peanut candies which I carried around for about a week and a half before finishing.

Dinner on the night train was… not spectacular.

The train was pretty nice though.

The next morning I would be in Hanoi!
