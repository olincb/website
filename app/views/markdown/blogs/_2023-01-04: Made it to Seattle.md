Grace and I made it to Seattle last night! Or... technically in the wee hours of this morning.

We spent New Year's around Minneapolis, spending time with Grace's family in the suburbs and with some friends in the city. It was great to see their whole family, including the newest member Kaylea! Congratulations to Kaylea and Jacob, who got married last week in an incredibly special and intimate wedding.

New Year's Eve was incredibly unexpected, but one of my favorites ever. We spent the night with one of Grace's friends from high school and her boyfriend. After an efficient trip to a St. Paul bar (back to back to back rounds of mystery shots!), we celebrated the new year with an Ecuadorian tradition called [año viejo](http://www.mannaproject.org/ecuadorblog/2021/1/15/new-years-in-ecuador). We jumped over a flaming wooden figurine crafted by the friendly groundskeeper of the Germanic-American Institute in St. Paul, and huddled around the fire, sharing what we all were leaving behind with 2022.

Yesterday our travel was plagued by delays from a Minneapolis snow storm that shut the entire airport down for hours, that turned what was supposed to be a 5-6 hour journey into a 9-10 hour one. One gate agent announced over the intercom something like "They told me the airport is closed, but honestly I'm not sure what that means. I think we'll have to deplane..." Later we found out the big delays were from a plane that had slid off the runway (everyone was okay as far as we could tell). Delays aside, we made it safely and for that I am grateful.

I'm excited to spend January snowboarding around Washington and Vancouver!
