I went snowboarding at Cypress mountain in Vancouver today!

My original plan was to go up yesterday but I got in Grandpa's truck that morning and it would not start. I still came up to Vancouver yesterday, just much later and with Grace and her roommates. We were all already planning on spending Saturday night at a hotel in Vancouver. We ate food, drove around Stanley Park, explored some shops in downtown, checked in to our hotel, got some drinks, had some dinner, found some CA$3.48 tequila shots at a restaurant/bar, got some more drinks and danced a bit, and finally called it a night. Overall, a very fun and successful day despite it not going according to my original plan.

Today I took a shuttle to the mountain from the Vancouver Art Gallery as I was without a car. When I got there, Cypress was very wet. The precipitation shifted throughout the day from rain to wet, heavy snow. The stuff on the ground was surprisingly rideable given the morning rain. There were also surprisingly many people out given the conditions, but still not too many. Visibility was incredibly poor, and I'm very glad I recently got some new goggles that came with low-vis lenses. I think there would be some pretty cool vistas from the mountain top, but this was all I got...

The drive back on the shuttle would have had an excellent view (I know because I've been there in the summer) but everything was fogged in still:

Overall, a very fun day. I think I'll push off additional trips to Cypress until things get a bit colder up there, though.
