My train ride from Sendai to Osaka was split over two legs, from Sendai to Tokyo and Tokyo to Osaka. I'm pretty much continually baffled at how easy it is to cover distance in Japan. The Shinkansen is not only incredibly fast, but also incredibly straightforward to use. Once again, I brought a bento box onboard, this time for dinner. I think this was the most gourmet bento box I had.

I arrived at my hostel in Shin-Osaka ("New Osaka"), and I felt pretty let down compared to my hostel in Sendai. It was a massive youth hostel but it felt soulless compared to the small homey feel of my previous hostel... and honestly every previous hostel I stayed at too. It provided fun things like a roommate who felt very sorry for himself all the time and liked to complain a lot; furniture and carpets from the 80s; a perpetually empty common space; and a rule that rooms must be unoccupied from 10am to 2pm. That being said, it had two key redeeming factors: one being the onsite onsen (artificial hot spring public bath), and the other being its proximity to the Shinkansen train station.

I had breakfast at Komeda's Coffee, which I've been to before (in Taiwan) but I didn't realize it was a Japanese chain at the time.

My first day in Osaka was pretty rainy, so I decided to go to the Asahi beer museum because it was inside. I arrived without a reservation so I had to wait pretty long for an English tour I could join. In the meantime, I went to a coffee shop nearby and wrote a blog post.

Asahi is my favorite Japanese (non-craft) brewery, which seems to be a bit of a hot take, I think in general people consider Sapporo to be higher quality. The scale of their brewery was pretty crazy.

Afterward, there was a free beer tasting. Which, interestingly, they didn't allow you to participate in if you drove _or bicycled_ to the museum.

Back in Shin-Osaka, I found an udon resaurant because I wanted to try kitsune udon, which is one of Osaka's specialties. It's udon with sweet tofu on top.

I was pretty hungry though, so I ordered some more udon, this time with tempura.

As I was eating, I struck up a conversation with the chef, whose name was Toyohiko-san. I think most people I talked to casually were pretty intrugued to talk to someone from the US, perhaps because most tourists are from other countries (a lot of Australians, for example). Anyway, after hearing about my nationality, Toyohiko-san relayed that information to some regulars as they were going from their table to the bathroom ("Kare wa Amerikajin desu!"). I learned they were two employees from a pharmaceutical company, and their boss, Tomioka-san. Tomioka-san stayed and chatted with Toyohiko-san and me for a long time. I think if I understood correctly, Tomioka-san asked Toyohiko-san to make "a Japanese snack" for me, and a few minutes later, I was presented with this intricately carved cucumber with fermented miso. It was the kind of thing where you feel bad for eating it because it's so pretty. After a photo and a compliment, I got over it and ate it (it was delicious).

Tomioka-san and I shared a large Asahi Super Dry, and we chatted about Japan, my travels, and Osaka. I learned some Osaka-ben too ("Ookini!"). Tomioka-san ended up paying for my meal... but only after the three of us got a photo together.

Overall, I think this was the best restaurant experience I've ever had. It was so fun to struggle through conversations with people whose English was only slightly better than my Japanese. And Toyohiko-san was so kind. I promised him I would come back soon, and I did (multiple times).

The next day, I took the local train into Osaka-proper for some sightseeing. I started at the castle, where I fulfilled my mom's request for "a photo of cherry blossoms with something cool in the background."

The line to get into the castle appeared to be hours long, so I skipped visiting the inside. The outside was very cool though, and there was a cool view around towards the city. Most Japanese castles are built up on hills, so they often seem to have pretty good views.

Nearby the castle is Hokoku shrine, which I intended to visit, but my plans were thwarted by a wedding that was happening there!

I got some street okonomiaki as I watched the procession enter the shrine.

Next, I continued on foot to Shinsekai. This area was very busy, with shops lining the streets and pedestrians packing the street, and bright signs up the fronts of all the buildings.

I had sushi for lunch at one of the aforementioned shops lining the streets.

Next, I walked to Shitennoji, a temple with a five story pagoda.

This was the first time I've been inside a pagoda, I think usually only monks are allowed inside. This one had thousands of little carved bronze pagodas with writing on them. I'm not sure, but I think they may represent dead family members (in place of a grave, for example).

After walking around some, I discovered some monks chanting, so I observed from a distance for a while.

From Shitennoji, I walked to Nipponbashi Denden Town, which reminded me a lot of Akihabara in Tokyo. There, I found some pokemon cards that were over $300 a piece, among many many other cards from card games and a lot of manga.

I also found this epic Sriracha vending machine.

I continued walking through Osaka, through Hozenji Yokocho:

And Dotonbori:

Dotonbori was a fun place to walk around. I finally got one of these ten yen pancakes that were filled with melted cheese. A surprisingly good combo. Sadly it did not actually cost ten yen...

For dinner, I stopped in a restaurant that allows smoking inside (unintentionally, and unfortunately) and had some curry omurice, which is rice with an omelette over it, and curry around all that. I don't think this was the most excellent example, usually they were far prettier.

Next... I got sick.
