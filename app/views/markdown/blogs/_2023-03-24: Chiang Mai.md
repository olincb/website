From one Chiang to another! To quote my friend Sean, “Wow, they’re good at naming cities, aren’t they?”

The bus ride left me much hungrier than expected so I basically made a beeline for the nearest restaurant to my hostel and ordered some Khao Soi. _This_ time, I finally got a photo!

I was also blessed with a neat cloudy sunset view from where I was sitting in the restaurant. Many restaurants are just completely open to the outside so this isn’t super uncommon. I’m not really sure how they deal with it in the rainy season…

Chiang Mai’s center is this big square with the ruins of walls and a moat surrounding it. It’s pretty neat honestly. My hostel was just outside the city’s moat.

I ventured into the main square for the evening and stumbled upon some live music so I decided to stop for a while.

My main goal for the evening was to watch some Muay Thai. I thought at this point that there was just one boxing stadium in the city, and it was the one I went to. But I later found out there are many, and the one I went to wasn’t even the main one. Regardless, it was cool to see. I’m not usually into watching people beat each other up but it was a fun time. They started with lighter weight classes and progressed to heavier fights through the night, but the first few fights were literally children, which was a little weird.

The next morning, I got my breakfast as I walked through a little market. I ended up getting this fried spring roll and some fruit.

I got a Thai massage after my breakfast. I don’t exactly remember how much it was but I would bet it was about $15 for an hour. I _*so*_ wish we could get massages that cheap at home. Thai massages are not exactly like the European oil massages you might expect. First, there’s no hole for your face in the table. Also, you keep clothes on (they provide a little robe set). Finally, they use a lot more pressure and move your body far more uncomfortably than they would in a  normal massage. That being said, I think afterwards you feel much better after a Thai massage. I definitely prefer it over a European massage.

Georgie arrived in Chiang Mai, so we met up for lunch. We went to a vegan restaurant. I think of any cuisine, Thai food lends itself best to vegetarian/vegan versions. In fact, I prefer all Thai food with tofu instead of meat. And it’s not really much different when made vegan too!

Aroi mak! (Very delicious!)

Seeing as I was now an expert scooter driver, I rented one from my hostel. Georgie and I took the scooter to a waterfall nearby Chiang Mai, Huai Kaeo waterfall.

![Georgie and I chilling in a waterfall](/blog/images/2023-03-24_waterfallchillin.jpg)

After chilling at what we thought was the main waterfall for a bit, we decided to hike up a trail there, to see if we could find another part that would be good for swimming. On the way we found a cool view of Chiang Mai.

![Georgie and I on the way up to the upper part of the waterfall](/blog/images/2023-03-24_waterfallviewselfie.jpg)

After getting over a bit of a hill we hit the jackpot, with an awesome pool for swimming and some more waterfall tiers. And if you’ve been following along closely, you’ll be able to guess who we ran into there. It was the two Irish girls again!

We also met a local who comes to the waterfall to cool off whenever it gets hot (must be frequent…). That’d be a nice thing to have in your backyard for whenever you want to cool off.

After the waterfall, we followed the winding road up the mountain to Doi Suthep, a temple atop the mountain and common pilgrimage location. It was a gorgeous temple, and it featured this massive golden _[chedi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa)_.

We were there at the right time to hear some monks chanting in a group, which was fascinating to witness.

There was a really cool view over Chiang Mai, including the airport where we could see planes landing and taking off.

![The view from Doi Suthep](/blog/images/2023-03-24_doisuthepview.jpg)

Weirdly, near this view point, there were some cows or something making mooing noises from the dark.

The winding roads down the mountain on the scooter were just as fun as the way up.

We found a very yummy vegetarian restaurant that was super close to both our hostels. They had this chick pea tofu that was _incredible_. Sadly my noodles were not as good, they were pretty much just noodles, scrambled eggs and tomatoes. Georgie’s Khao Soi was top notch though, I’m told, so overall a good place to go.

![Last dinner with Georgie](/blog/images/2023-03-24_georgiedinner.jpg)

The next morning, Georgie departed for Vietnam. We had breakfast outside our hostels (they were next door) and said goodbye for the last time for a while. 

Friends you meet traveling are weird. They’re typically fun and interesting but you know there will come a point where either you’ll never see them again or if you do it’s going to be a long time. It helps that you know this is the case going in, but it’s still a tough goodbye. But now I have a great reason to visit the UK and also a place to stay when I do!

I still had the motorbike through the afternoon so I decided to take a trip up to the “sticky waterfalls.” The water flowing out of the spring there has minerals dissolved in it which deposit on the ground as it goes down the slope, leaving a rough white coating on the ground. This makes it very easy to walk up and down, hence the name.

I met an Israeli guy there, and we exchanged photo shoots of each of us perched on this part of the waterfall.

![Perched on a ledge at the sticky waterfall](/blog/images/2023-03-24_stickywaterfall.jpg)

This was the next person I kept running into all over the place (though of course I didn’t know that yet).

I got some pad Thai by the exit of the parking lot before scooting back to Chiang Mai. Tofu, once again.

![Pad thai at the sticky waterfall](/blog/images/2023-03-24_stickywaterfallpadthai.jpg)

To combat the egregious farmer’s tan you can see in all the waterfall pictures and videos so far, I did the scooter ride back to Chiang Mai with my sleeves rolled up. It worked a bit too well and I arrived with shoulders and legs red as a lobster.

Continuing my unintentional mission of eating at all the vegetarian places in Chiang Mai, I went to another veg restaurant and got some yummy rad na. I’ve mentioned this dish a few times already but if you’re unfamiliar, it’s usually wide noodles with a sort of gravy. Somewhere between noodles with a sauce and noodles in a soup.

![Veg rad na](/blog/images/2023-03-24_vegradna.jpg)

As I was leaving the restaurant, I noticed some big bins of weird shaped… beans? fruits? The owner saw my puzzled look and offered one to me and told me it was tamarind, what gives pad Thai its unique, almost tart flavor. Having it in pad thai, you barely notice the tartness, if at all. Eating tamarind straight… you definitely notice it. It was good, I would recommend trying it!

After dinner I wandered roughly toward where Chiang Mai’s night bazaar is. Before I got there though, I got distracted by some live music in a bar and sat down to watch.

When they were done I continued to the night bazaar. As I arrived, most stalls were starting to pack up shop, but I could hear some more music in the distance. I followed my ears to another bar where a band was playing 90s rock.

So I didn’t really get to explore the night bazaar, but I’ll trade that for two live music experiences.

The next day I had a cooking class! We started with a visit to the morning market to shop for ingredients. Riko, our instructor, was wearing this (Steph) Curry jersey.

![Instructor Riko wearing a curry shirt](/blog/images/2023-03-24_curryshirt.jpg)

Appropriately, she also showed us the way to this curry (paste).

![Curry paste at the market](/blog/images/2023-03-24_currypaste.jpg)

The market was bustling and very cool to witness with a guide who knew what was happening.

![Vegetables for sale at the market](/blog/images/2023-03-24_marketveg.jpg)

![The market is crazy busy in the morning](/blog/images/2023-03-24_market.jpg)

We arrived at the kitchen and got ready to cook!

![Ready to cook!](/blog/images/2023-03-24_knife.jpg)

My first course was spring rolls and tom kha soup. The tom kha was much paler than I’ve always seen it in restaurants. If I got soup that looked like this in a Thai restaurant at home, I would expect the coconut milk to be overwhelming (in fact I have gotten soup that looked like this, and indeed the coconut milk was overpowering). But in the soup I made, the coconut milk was not overwhelming, and the flavors were quite balanced if I do say so myself.

![Tom kha and spring rolls for the first course](/blog/images/2023-03-24_tomkhaspringrolls.jpg)

For the next course, I had a lot of fun cooking the tofu:

I made khao soi and pad Thai! My favorite course.

![Khao soi and pad thai for the second course](/blog/images/2023-03-24_khaosoiandpadthai.jpg)

Next, I made larb. Despite using half the recommended amount of coriander (cilantro), it still came out tasting like the secret ingredient was a pump of hand soap. I think it had to do with using “Thai coriander” (which does not look like regular coriander) as well. My least favorite course.

![Larb for the third course](/blog/images/2023-03-24_larb.jpg)

Finally, for dessert, I made mango sticky rice. SO yummy.

![Mango sticky rice for dessert](/blog/images/2023-03-24_mangostickyrice.jpg)

I don’t want to brag too much, but I was told I cook like a Thai by one of the instructors, due to my tolerance for spiciness (which we got to adjust in each dish to our taste) and general kitchen skills.

Here is Riko and I after the class.

![Riko and I](/blog/images/2023-03-24_riko.jpg)

And the whole crew!

After cooking class, I decided to take advantage of the very cheap cost of… everything, and got my nails painted.

![Painted nails](/blog/images/2023-03-24_nails1.jpg)

![The other hand](/blog/images/2023-03-24_nails2.jpg)

That night I had yet another bowl of khao soi for dinner, from a night market near my hostel. I can confirm it’s just as tasty from a street stall, and it comes even cheaper!

![Street khao soi](/blog/images/2023-03-24_streetkhaosoi.jpg)

The next morning was my last in Chiang Mai. I went back to the place with the chickpea tofu to get some more, as well as this Shan yellow noodle salad (Shan is an ethnic minority hill tribe in northern Thailand, I believe). It was much better than my scrambled egg noodles I had the first time here.

![Shan yellow noodle salad](/blog/images/2023-03-24_shannoodlesalad.jpg)

With some breakfast/lunch in me, I was ready to continue my journey.

I packed up my small backpack with my necessities, left my big backpack at my hostel, and rented a scooter for the next five days. I was ready to embark on the Mae Hong Son Loop.
