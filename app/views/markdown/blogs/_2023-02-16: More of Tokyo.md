I’m going to structure this post by theme, rather than chronology. Also, I’ve scattered a few links to Youtube videos throughout. I’m not sure it was clear in my last post that there were links to videos. 

## Food

Naturally, I’ve been getting ramen pretty regularly (when in Rome or something). This was from Ramen Street, which is inside Tokyo Station.

![Ramen](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ramen_street.JPG)

I almost missed a train I needed to catch because I stopped for this ramen, but I’m so glad I did. It would have been worth it to miss the train, it was so good.

![Ramen](/blog/images/2023-02-16_yoyogi_ramen.JPG)

An unexpected favorite food I’ve found here is curry bread. It’s crispy on the outside and is filled with a sort of sweet curry. SO good!

In Asakusa:

From 7-11 near the Kawaguchiko Train station:

![Currybread](/blog/images/2023-02-16_currybread2.JPG)

I’ve seen these strawberry sandwiches at like every 7-11 so I had to get one. It was good but I think they’re overpriced at like ¥400. I had this one at the Kawaguchiko train station with my curry bread:

The day I checked out of my hostel, it was rainy and cold so I scrapped one of the things I was planning on doing. I returned to the hostel to play some Smash Bros and finalize some of my Vietnam itinerary in the lobby. Turned out they were making an all you can eat dinner for ¥500 per person so I decided to stay for that. They made these shredded cabbage onion potato meat pancake things which were **amazing**:

I didn’t know japan had their own version of curry, but they do it very well. Not inside bread this time:

![Japanese Curry](/blog/images/2023-02-16_curry.JPG)

I wouldn’t have gotten a burger when traveling in Asia if not by someone’s suggestion, but my mom’s friend Michiko recommended it. It turns out MOS burger is _quite_ good. Best fast food service I’ve experienced. The MOS burger itself:

![MOS burger](/blog/images/2023-02-16_mos_burger.JPG)

I also had a crepe (not pictured) at the suggestion of  Michiko, and it was also phenomenal.

Breakfast here is pretty different, but I like it a lot. Rice, pickles (pickled vegetables, not necessarily cucumbers), egg (in various states of cooked-ness), and meat or fish are common breakfast foods.

![Japanese breakfast](/blog/images/2023-02-16_breakfast2.JPG)

The breakfast above came with nattō, fermented soybeans. I’m glad I got it… but I could only eat one bite. Pretty much everything about it was off putting.

![Natto](/blog/images/2023-02-16_natto.JPG)

At the ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) I stayed at, traditional Japanese dinner and breakfast were served. Both were delicious. It was here that I learned the name of another newfound favorite: takana (Japanese giant red mustard greens; typically pickled).

![Breakfast at the ryokan](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ryokan breakfast.JPG)

The dinner was HUGE. I think it’s considered rude to leave food on your plate but I physically could not finish all of it, and left some grilled eel and rice.

## Accommodation

I checked out of the hostel :(

I had just sort of made some friends there.

But the next stop, the capsule hotel in Shinjuku, was very cool:

![Many capsules](/blog/images/2023-02-16_capsule_hotel.JPG)

![My capsule](/blog/images/2023-02-16_capsule.JPG)

I discovered an interesting way of sorting garbage there:

![Combustible and non combustible](/blog/images/2023-02-16_bins.JPG)

I relaxed in the public bath (a fake hot spring), and had complimentary shochu and rice. There were more people there for sure, but it’s a far less social vibe than the hostel.

After 2 nights, I checked out and [took the train](https://youtu.be/XtiFpwAOUJA) to Lake Kawaguchi, where I stayed in a ryokan. Here’s my room:

![My room in the ryokan](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ryokan.JPG)

A kimono was supplied:

![Me in a kimono](/blog/images/2023-02-16_kimono.JPG)

There was an onsen (hot spring bath house) with an open air bath. It was 27°F when I went out there, and it was a very fun and relaxing time.

## Temples and Shrines

This is Sensō-Ji, in Asakusa:

![Senso-ji and trees](/blog/images/2023-02-16_sensoji3.JPG)

![Senso-ji, medium distance](/blog/images/2023-02-16_sensoji1.JPG)

![Senso-ji up close](/blog/images/2023-02-16_sensoji2.JPG)

There I also [saw some koi](https://youtu.be/qhseGziOah0) ([speedy koi over here](https://youtu.be/yhhBeXyXncQ)).

This is the pagoda there:

![Five story pagoda](/blog/images/2023-02-16_pagoda.JPG)

I received a bad fortune:

![Bad fortune](/blog/images/2023-02-16_bad_fortune.JPG)

But thankfully I later got this slightly better fortune at Meiji Jingu:

![Neutral fortune](/blog/images/2023-02-16_good_fortune.JPG)

Speaking of, here’s me going into Meiji Jingu:

![Me under a large arch](/blog/images/2023-02-16_meiji_jingu_door.JPG)

And in front of the temple:

![Me in front of Meiji Jingu](/blog/images/2023-02-16_meiji_jingu.JPG)

The sake distillers of the area (and elsewhere in Japan) offer barrels of sake each year to the enshrined deities at Meiji Jingu:

## The City

### Day Life

I saw an interesting skyline, coming out of Asakusa Staion:

![Tokyo skytree and a radish building](/blog/images/2023-02-16_skyline.JPG)

Asakusa has a network of shopping streets lined with markets. I love these areas, they’re so fun to explore. Here are some photos from another similar area, Ameyoko:

![Many market stalls](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ameyoko3.JPG)

![More vendors](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ameyoko2.JPG)

![Alley under the elevated tracks](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ameyoko1.JPG)

I found this ninja shoe at a market in Asakusa, and was tempted to find one in my size:

![Shoe with big toe separated](/blog/images/2023-02-16_ninja_shoe.JPG)

I went to Akihabara at night but it’s not really a “night life” area, more of an all the time kind of area. It’s sort of like the Times Square of anime…

![Anime billboards line the street](/blog/images/2023-02-16_akihabara.JPG)

I was invited to go with some people from the hostel and I’m glad I went with them, because otherwise I wouldn’t have known to explore the 7 floors of Don Quijote. They had everything from claw machines to groceries to costumes to arcade games to sex toys to liquor to colored eye contacts. [Here’s a video of someone from the hostel playing the drums there](https://youtu.be/cKhe1K823uI).

We also saw this guy, who looks like he’s on his way to the Tokyo Drift film set:

![Anime themed car](/blog/images/2023-02-16_tokyo_drift.JPG)

From Shinjuku, I went up to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, and saw some crazy views of Tokyo. You can really appreciate how immense the city is from up there.

![View of the city from above](/blog/images/2023-02-16_city_view.JPG)

![Sun sets over Tokyo](/blog/images/2023-02-16_sunset.JPG)

![A sketch I made](/blog/images/2023-02-16_tmgb_sketch.JPG)

There was a piano up there, with talented people (or untalented people with no social anxiety) free to play for everyone. I got two videos [here](https://youtu.be/qGqwUYwFwAg) and [here](https://youtu.be/t5Cn6S_9hHk) of people playing.

[Here’s a time lapse video of the world’s busiest crosswalk](https://youtu.be/9U20_V-3nT0).

Another fun city thing has been the trains, but this train out of the city to the Fuji area was the nicest I’ve seen so far:

![Train with wooden floors](/blog/images/2023-02-16_fuji_train.JPG)

### Night Life

I pregamed my trip to Golden Gai with a visit to Kurand Sake Market, where I had 30 minutes of all you can drink sake for ¥1500. Great deal. Turns out I like umami sake the most, and rich dry sake the second most. Also it turns out I prefer plum wine to sake altogether.

![Three sake glasses](/blog/images/2023-02-16_sake.JPG)

Grace’s uncle Ron recommended Golden Gai to me, and it really delivered. It’s a grid of these micro-bars with 5-10 seats each. I had a drink in one place, then moved on to find another. I stayed in the next one for a long time and got pretty sloshed exchanging broken Japanese for the bartender’s broken English. We talked about music much of the time. I really enjoyed his company. Sadly I don’t remember his name. I do have [a link to his band’s only youtube video](https://youtu.be/W4z7Yq-p-R0) though.

![Many bars](/blog/images/2023-02-16_goldengai.JPG)

![Sign with their rules](/blog/images/2023-02-16_goldengai_sign.JPG)

Many of the bars have a cover charge. This was the steepest though…

![100000 yen cover](/blog/images/2023-02-16_expensive_cover.JPG)

I thought this one was interesting:

![Baltimore jazz bar](/blog/images/2023-02-16_baltimore.JPG)

I think this was adjacent to Golden Gai and not actually in it:

![American style pub](/blog/images/2023-02-16_american_pub.JPG)

I also went to Piss Alley, known for its many bars and absence of bathrooms:

![Piss Alley](/blog/images/2023-02-16_piss_alley.JPG)

[I took a video of me walking the length of it](https://youtu.be/SN7_4RjfidI).

Strawberries are in season here apparently, so one night I got a strawberry highball:

![Drink with a strawberry](/blog/images/2023-02-16_strawberry_highball.JPG)

Followed by a flight of Japanese whiskey:

![Three bottles of whiskey](/blog/images/2023-02-16_whiskey.JPG)

My ranking:

1. Hibiki
2. Yamazaki (but a close second)
3. Hakushu

## Nature

### 36 Views of Mt. Fuji

Started my Fuji viewing from the shore of Lake Kawaguchiko:

![Fuji](/blog/images/2023-02-16_fuji1.JPG)

![Me and Fuji](/blog/images/2023-02-16_fuji2.JPG)

Then took a cable car up to an observation deck on a hillside:

![Me and Fuji](/blog/images/2023-02-16_fuji3.JPG)

Curry bread and rice wrapped in pork from the mountaintop cafe for lunch:

![Lunch and Fuji](/blog/images/2023-02-16_fuji_food.JPG)

I did a small hike to the Tenjosan Komitake Shrine and got some more Fuji views:

### Other Nature

I went to Shinjuku Gyoen National garden which was very cool. [Here’s a video of some birds chirping there](https://youtu.be/P9edduvlBPo). I met a Tokyoite whose nickname was Sam and he asked if he could take my portrait. He said something like “I found a good spot. This tree is a very classic Japanese tree.” I followed him on instagram so we’ll see if I end up there.

This was a view from the train to Lake Kawaguchiko:

![Mountain valley](/blog/images/2023-02-16_train_view.JPG)

And lake Kawaguchiko itself:
