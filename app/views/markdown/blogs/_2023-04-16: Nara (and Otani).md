## Nara

After Kyoto, I took the train to Nara and left my big bag in a locker at the train station. The city is named Nara, but it's also the name of the large park between the denser, urban area of the city and the neighboring hill/mountain. Nara is famous for its docile deer, and it did not disappoint. They sell little packs of rice cakes to feed to the deer near the entrance to the main park. The deer are very aware that people will feed them (which is, I believe, how they became docile in the first place), and they are _not_ shy when hungry.

As I was feeding some deer (or maybe just after), one came up from behind and nibbled on my shirt.

Many were hanging out near the food, but probably about half were dispersed throughout the park, which was quite large.

After feeding them at the entrance to the main park, I took a small hike up the neighboring hill to a different park on the hilltop.

Surprisingly, the deer were up there too, and just as ready to recieve food as the ones at the bottom of the hill.

The hill had a nice view in nearly 360 degrees. This is the view away from Nara.

And this is the view towards Nara.

When I had had my fill of cute, friendly deer, I started making my way down the mountain. I stopped at a bench to eat a pastry I had picked up at a convenience store, and kept in my day bag. This was a foolish decision. A bold (read: average) deer decided my pastry was now hers, and I couldn't really argue with her (they are still wild animals, after all). With all my snacks gone, I made my way into the city to find some dinner.

I ended up finding some Hiroshima style okonomiyaki, though at the time I didn't know it was Hiroshima style, I just thought they were quirky at this restaurant. The difference is that they put noodles in it, which I honestly think I prefer. Here is how okonomiyaki is made!

## Otani

After dinner, I went back to the train station, grabbed my big bag, and continued on my way to Otani. My plan for the next day was to do a hike up an old pilgrimage road from Koyaguchi up a mountain to Koyasan. Unfortunately, due to the last-minute nature of my booking, there was no longer anything affordable in Koyaguchi so I was forced to book my accomodations three stops further down the train line, in Otani.

Koyaguchi was already pretty far off the tourism path, but Otani was on another level. This was the train station I disembarked at:

I then had a 20 minute walk along unlit streets without sidewalks (which, in a city would have been normal on side streets, but this was definitely suburban) until I arrived at my hotel.

On booking.com, my accomodation's name was in Japanese so I didn't think too much about it. Upon arrival, however, I was having _serious_ second thoughts. It turned out to be called Hotel Chapel Christmas, painted in pastels (mostly pink), and feature a huge statue of Santa.

The front door was once transparent glass, but was now an opaque red. It was also locked. I was worried I may have arrived too late, which was not something I wanted to figure out how to deal with so far away from... anything else, really. I walked around the building to the entrance facing the parking lot, though, and it was open. The lobby appeared to be empty. I anounced my presence with some confusion in my voice ("sumimasen?") and eventually someone came through a door and asked if I had a reservation. I told him my name and he said "ah yes, two rooms, right?" I told him I'd only need one room (not sure why that happened). As he was retrieving my key, I saw a man come in from the parking lot, and perform the standard set of steps for getting a room:

He went to a vending machine in front of the door, pressed some buttons, paid in cash, and was issued a ticket.

He went to the counter which had a curtain around it and placed the ticked at a small hand-sized opening in the curtain, on the counter.

A hand emerged from behind the curtain and grabbed the ticket. A moment passed and the hand placed a key where the ticket had been.

The man grabbed the key, and left the lobby.

It was at this time I also noticed a set of shelves with a multitude of intimate products for sale, and I put together the pieces of the puzzle. This hotel was pretty much exclusively for having sex anonymously.

The hotel staff came back through the door with my key, and pointed me in the direction of my room (outside, down a covered walkway to the next building). I got into my room, and this is what I saw:

Feeling thoroughly grossed out, I made sure to touch as few things as possible and avoid the leather couch at all costs.

My alarm woke me up early the next morning, as I would need an early start for the pilgrimage. On my way out (I walked out a different way than I came in), I saw the other entrance, complete with four more Santa statues.

This easily qualifies as the strangest experience I had on my trip, hands down. It wasn't a bad experience, nor a good one... just extremely strange.

Next: the Choishi-michi pilgrimage road and Koyasan.
