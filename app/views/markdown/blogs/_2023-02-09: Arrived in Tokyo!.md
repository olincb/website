I arrived in Tokyo around 6am local time this morning, an hour later than anticipated due to a plane swap in LA
(I'm glad we didn't take the plane with the leaking hydraulics in one of its engines).
I went to the largest fish market in the world, but was too late for any of the auctions so I think I'll go again tomorrow.
I had some _delicious_ sushi there (omakase of course).

After a bit of lounging after I checked in at the hostel, I walked to the Nihonbashi district and fell in love with its tiny alleys.
That's a bit dramatic but it was such a cool experience, just wandering from street to street with no goal in particular.
I went to a bar for an oolong highball, buckwheat Shochu, and an Asahi Super Dry, then found an udon shop for dinner.

Turning in early tonight to get up for the tuna auction tomorrow...
I'll dump my photos from today in my next post.
