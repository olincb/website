After coming down from Alishan, we took the (slow) train down to Tainan. We pretty much spent 2 nights and 1 day in Tainan, as we got there the afternoon of the 22nd, and left the morning of the 24th.

Tainan was originally a major port for Dutch colonists, so they constructed a fort there to protect the area. Over the course of history as different groups rose to and fell from power in Taiwan, the fort changed hands and parts were removed, added, changed and preserved. It’s now a museum with a few archeological areas and a tower that you can go to the top of.

At some point in the past, the banyan tree was introduced to Taiwan and it really took off. To the point where it seems now accepted as a native plant.

One banyan tree in particular is famous for having consumed an old house, growing in, over, and around many parts of it.

The tree house area is also home to a tea/local beer shop where we tried a Jasmine Session Ale and a Tea Ale, both very good. It was a refreshing change of pace from the lagers which seem to be the go-to in most parts of Asia I’ve been to so far.

Tainan is home to some very narrow old streets, some of which feature the ruins of old colonial homes. It was interesting to try to imagine what life might have looked like there hundreds of years ago.

We also discovered this fun whale sculpture in Tainan…

One fun perk of Taiwan is their singing garbage trucks, which lets people know when to bring their trash out.

Tainan is also famous for their food, which we experienced at two night markets there, and in some stalls along the narrow old streets of the Anping area. My favorite was a soft peanut cilantro candy. That’s really saying something since I have the cilantro-tastes-like-soap gene… but it really just works well. Another fun one were “cow tongues,” which it turns out are actually just bread pastries that vaguely resemble a long tongue.

On the morning of the 24th, we got back on the high speed rail up to Taipei, and from there we got back on a slow train to Hualien.
