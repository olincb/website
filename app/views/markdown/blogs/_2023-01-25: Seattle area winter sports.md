For the past few weeks I've been spending most of my time doing various winter sports around Seattle... most notably, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and skiing!

## Snowboarding

Since Cypress in Vancouver, I've mostly been snowboarding at Snoqualmie (the Alpental base area primarily), but also at Crystal.

Grandpa's truck is still in the shop so I've taken the [To The Mountain Shuttle](https://tothemountainshuttle.com/) to Snoqualmie a couple times now, when I'm not able to borrow Grace's car (thank you Grace).

Snoqualmie Central reminds me of any other average ski resort, but is nice.
My first morning there it was completely socked in and impossible to see:

Thankfully that same day it cleared up on one side of the mountain:

Alpental, though technically still at Snoqualmie, is a whole other beast.
It's not big, but it is _steep_ and _deep_.
It also has a neat bridge over this beautiful creek at the entrance:

My first day there started out with even worse visibility than at Snoqualmie Central, but eventually it cleared up to reveal some spectacular views from Chair 2:

More recently, I went to Crystal, which many say is the best skiing in Washington.
I can confirm that at the very least, the views at Crystal are the best of anywhere I've been, including Colorado mountains.
From the top of the gondola, you're greeted by Mt. Rainier, front and center (on the right in my photo), as well as Mt. St. Helens in the distance to the left:

Sadly the snow wasn't the best there that day.
It was very fast on the groomers which was fun, but everything ungroomed was incredibly crusty.

## Snowshoeing

Two weekends ago, Grace and I took a trip to the Olympic Peninsula with the intention of skiing at Hurricane Ridge.
Their only lift was not open due to inadequate snow pack, leaving only two rope tows open.
So... we decided to snowshoe instead! It was my first time, and it was quite fun!
A huge thank you to Jill for letting Grace and I stay at her home in Poulsbo for our trip!

## Skiing

Finally... I'm learning how to ski!
I've been out skiing twice now, once at Snoqualmie (Central):

And once at Crystal:

I hate to say it, but I am _really_ enjoying skiing.
So far I'm only comfortable on groomed blues, but I'm slowly working on getting into the ungroomed stuff.
Honestly I've had such a good time with it that I think the next winter sports purchase I make is going to be skis.
We'll see when that happens though.

I have about another week here in Washington before a quick trip down to Palm Springs with Grace, Carolyn and Jill (thank you again, Jill!).
Time flies!
