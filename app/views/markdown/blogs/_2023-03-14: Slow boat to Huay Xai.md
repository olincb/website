After the morning alms and morning market in Luang Prabang, a tuk tuk collected me and a group of backpackers to get to the slow boat dock. I guess I should have mentioned in the last post what tuk tuks are… They’re a very common mode of transport in SE Asia, but I think only tourists really use them. In Laos, they’re either a pickup truck with a roof over the back and a bench on each side, or something similar but much smaller, with a motorcycle for the front half instead of a pickup truck. In thailand there were only the three-wheeled motorcycle kind, and there was only one bench seat that faced forward instead of sideways. They had the pickup truck kind too but they called them something else.

After a confusing series of exchanging boat vouchers for intermediate vouchers for tickets, we were let onto the boat.

The slow boats are very long covered boats, probably 100ft long and 10ft wide. The seats are old car or van seats, which are just attached to wood blocks so they can be moved around.

They have a bathroom on board… but it’s best to take care of business before leaving I think.

Behind the bathroom is a *massive*, super loud, fully exposed diesel engine. I think OSHA might have something to say about it if they had the chance. I didn’t risk spending much time near it. I didn’t get a photo or video from this boat, but it was similar to this one from the slightly smaller boat I was on a few days prior:

The journey takes 2 days, about 10 hours each day in the upstream direction. The scenery up the river was gorgeous, especially just after leaving Luang Prabang. 

The boat made several stops on the way up the river, to drop off and pick up supplies, deliveries, and local people. The places where the boat would stop were absurd; anything remotely jutting into the river was a dock.

I have no clue how the captain knew where to stop, or how the locals arranged their pickups or drop offs… there were no intermediate stop options for me when I bought my ticket. (“Yeah can you pick me up from the path that comes out of the forest at the beach after the big pointy rock? Thanks.”)

My favorite pieces of cargo we carried were two motorbikes which were driven onto the boat and dropped at one of the more official looking docks we stopped at along the way (a floating plastic dock with concrete steps into the forest).

After the first day we made it to Pak Beng, where the dock was _very_ crowded.

I accidentally booked a private room for myself which was a nice treat after so much time in dorms.

The guesthouse had a really nice view over the river.

I had larb for dinner at the restaurant next to the guest house. It’s pronounced “lahb” or “lob,” with a sort of silent R. Many english spellings are based on more British pronunciation in SE Asia due to colonialism, so most of the time an R in isn’t really pronounced. For example, Myanmar is actually pronounced more like Myanmah.

Larb is considered to be a salad I think but it’s pretty much just a pile of ground or minced meat mixed with some herbs, on some lettuce. This one was very good but most times I’ve had larb they’ve used *far* too much coriander (that’s rest-of-the-world-English for cilantro) for my taste.

The second day, we boarded a different boat, and continued up the river. There were more people on the boat the second day, so there were far fewer empty seats. Luckily I still got a row to myself, it was nice to be able to lay down.

Some of the currents we were going against were something to behold… kudos to our incredibly skilled captain. The knowledge they must have of the river is really impressive. I had done my research and had heard no horror stories about the slow boat crashing so I wasn’t worried, but I think a wrong turn could have been very bad news for our wooden boat.

At one point, the river turns into the Lao-Thai border. It’s interesting because you can see a stark difference between the countries. Laos is clearly behind Thailand in terms of development. The buildings on the Thai side were far nicer and more numerous, and there were people partying on the beaches. The Lao side was pretty much just home to forests, cattle grazing, and sleepy, rustic villages.

We got to Huay Xai and created a parking spot for ourselves among the tightly packed long boats at the dock.

The previous day I had given half the kip (Lao currency) in my wallet to a fellow backpacker since he hadn’t been able to go to the ATM and he needed to pay for a room in Pak Beng (not for free… he paypal’d me). This meant I got to Huay Xai with something like 10,000 kip (about $0.60). Thankfully another traveler paid for my tuk tuk fare into town.

That night I went to the night market for food. Maybe I was there at the wrong time but it was easily the sleepiest night market I’ve been to. I got sausage and meat on a stick, and some _very_ spicy Lao pho.

The next day I would start The Gibbon Experience!
