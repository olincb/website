Arriving in Kyoto, my next hostel was a relief compared to the one in Osaka. It was only slightly more soacial, in fact it felt a lot like the capsule hotel I stayed at in Tokyo, but it was far more modern, generally nicer, and you weren't required to vacate your room by 10 am.

I started with some temples nearby. Kyoto has _many_ temples, each seemingly with their own special thing making them unique. First, Ryozen Kannon, with this large statue of Buddha, and incense sticks to go with your entrance ticket (usually these are available for purchase, but don't come with the cost of admission).

Ryozen Kannon was slightly up a hill, and had a cool view toward the next temple I would visit, Kodai-ji.

Kodai-ji had a beautiful garden with a circuitous walking path, and some smaller buildings like this one.

It was very picturesque, but it was hard to get a photo without hoards of tourists in the photo as well. This seemed to be the theme of Kyoto at large, actually. It's a tourist destination for good reason, but it's hard to feel like you're really experiencing a place when you're surrounded by folks with cargo shorts on and cameras out. 

Next, I found some lunch at what ended up being tied for my most-visited restaurant of my entire trip. I had some spicy abura soba noodles and fried chicken. Abura soba is like ramen but without broth, and the noodles also felt a bit thicker, but I'm not sure if it's always like that. These were some of my favorite noodles I had, maybe tied with the ramen I had in Shinjuku (Tokyo) and some iterations of khao soi from Thailand. I think it was the spicy sauce they were coated in that made them so good.

I found a street food vendor that sold taiyaki, which was very exciting because it was my favorite sweet to get from convenience stores (and it's even better when it's fresh, though the convenience stores do a great job with them).

I think, still slightly recovering from my illness, I called an early night and ended up basically skipping dinner. I worked on a blog post from the comfort and privacy of my bed capsule.

The next morning, I went for some more spicy abura soba noodles for breakfast, from the same place as last time (it was called Nekomata).

My destination for the morning was a nail salon, because the nails I had done in Chiang Mai were extremely grown out at this point.

On the way, I got some mochi balls which were impossibly chewy. I think the flavors were sakura (cherry blossom), regular mochi flavor, and matcha (green tea).

There's a calm river that goes through Kyoto, with nice views from the bridges over it, and a serene looking path that parallels it. This area (especially on the left side from this perspective) felt much less touristy than the area near my hostel and many of the temples, which took up much of the Higashiyama Ward. It was in this area that I could imagine living as a local, being able to appreciate the beauty of Kyoto without the massive swarms of tourists.

After I got my nails ground down with a dremel tool, and repainted (regular nail polish this time, so I could take care of getting rid of them myself when the time came), I started walking to see a number of temples I had saved on my map.

The first was Heian-jingu Shrine. Here, I found these little cherry blossoms which weren't actually cherry blossoms, though I only noticed that after getting pretty close actually. You could pay to get a fortune on a slip of pink paper. Typically, the practice is to tie your paper to something if you get a bad fortune... but typically it's just to a fence or array of little wires by the fortunes. This time, the fortunes made the blossoms on these trees!

![Fortunes tied to sticks look like cherry blossoms](/blog/images/2023-04-15_fortunes.jpg)

Behind the temple was a gorgeous garden with a walking path. There was a particularly picturesque area with some red maples, a pond, and some buildings.

The whole garden was amazing, though, so I made this fun little video of the walk-through.

Next, I walked along the "Philosopher's Path," which parallels this very cute little canal. The neighborhoods it went through seemed so quaint and peaceful.

![Canal alongside the "Philosopher's Path"](/blog/images/2023-04-15_canal.jpg)

At the end of the Philosopher's Path, I arrived at Higashiyama Jisho-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple and garden. They had it all: a pond with a building in it, a rock/pebble garden, a moss garden, a regular garden, and even a path up a hill so you could look down at all their gardens.

There were a lot of tourists here, limiting the zen-ness of the experience, but it wasn't quite as packed as the temples I went to the previous day so it was still pretty peaceful.

At this point, I was itching to do some hiking or just get out into nature, having been shut up in a hotel for like four days, and just doing city and temple viewing on either end of those four days. Conveniently, there seemed to be some trails up into the hills that started near where I was. I used my tried and true method of combining AllTrails, Google Maps, and just walking wherever looked cool, to meander up the hill and through the forest. At one point, I was faced with a big decision at this massive trail intersection:

I had a moment where I ran out of cell service, and was wishing I had looked up if there were any poisonous snakes in this area... There were two snakes who appeared to be doing some kind of foreplay before mating. I basically just waited for them to get far enough off the path before contintuing at a safe distance.

One of my intended destinations on this hike was Nakao Falls, which I had seen a marker for on Google Maps. Sadly, upon arrival, I think I was out of season for the stream, and I don't think it would have been too impressive anyway. This was my best guess at where the "falls" were supposed to be...

![Nakao falls in all its glory?](/blog/images/2023-04-15_nakaofalls.jpg)

I ended up making a nice little loop, emerging from the forest pretty close to where I entered, but from a trail I hadn't noticed on the way in.

For dinner, I went to a restaurant that specialized in tofu. They had a few different options, but basically it was just a choice between some predetermined combinations of tofu served different ways.

It was very good, and I was surprised at how not-boring it was, given it was mostly the same food.

The next morning, I started once again at Nekomata for some spicy abura soba. The staff completely recognized me at this point... I think they thought it was funny I was coming back so much.

It ended up raining on and off for much of the day. They have a lot of clear umbrellas in Japan, which I love. It lets you see things through your umbrella, without having to look out from under it. It also lets you take fun selfies like this one:

![Pagoda seen through the umbrella](/blog/images/2023-04-15_umbrella.jpg)

The rain was not super convenient for being out and about, but I only had so much time for sightseeing, so I took advantage nonetheless. It did make for some very cool street scenes, like these.

That last one was the entrance to Kiyomizu-dera temple, which was my favorite temple in Kyoto. Shortly after entering, at a pagoda before the main building of the temple, I ran into an amazing group of dudes just doing some standard sightseeing at the temple:

![I pose with some dudes dressed as teletubbies](/blog/images/2023-04-15_teletubbies.jpg)

This was a peak Japanese experience, I would say.

The temple itself is on the side of the hill, and much of it is built on stilts, looking like its floating atop the trees. This is one of my favorite photos from my trip.

![Kiyomizu-dera temple on the hill above the trees](/blog/images/2023-04-15_kiyomizudera.jpg)

And of course here's a version with me in it.

And another angle with the aforementioned pagoda visible.

On my way back to my hostel, I stopped for a snack which reminded me a lot of guabao from Taiwan, though it didn't have nearly as many things in it.

![Street bun](/blog/images/2023-04-15_bun.jpg)

I also stopped at a craft brewery for some non-lager style beers (uncommon in Asia, as I've mentioned before).

![Beer flight at craft brewery](/blog/images/2023-04-15_beer.jpg)

For dinner, I found a restaurant that served vegan ramen, which was deliscious, and ironically, somewhat creamy. Of all the countries I visited, I think Japan would be one of the hardest to eat vegetarian or vegan in, mostly because so many of their noodles use meat or bones to make the broth. This place was a welcome exception, especially because they did such a good job keeping it delicious but also still very ramen-like.

![Vegan ramen](/blog/images/2023-04-15_veganramen.jpg)

The next morning, I spent some time packing up my stuff and found some conveyor belt sushi for breakfast/brunch. Come to think of it, I think I had as much conveyor belt sushi as sushi from standard restaurants in japan... No regrets, though, because it was delicious and extremely affordable for a big meal.

![Conveyor belt sushi for brunch](/blog/images/2023-04-15_sushi.jpg)

My last destination in Kyoto was Sanjusangen-do. This temple has a long building (the name translates to "temple of 33 bays") filled with 1001 thousand-armed Kannon statues (I believe Kannon is the Japanese equivalent of a Bodhisatva from Buddhism). 

![Very long building in temple with a bunch of statues inside](/blog/images/2023-04-15_sanjusangendo.jpg)

I can confirm that there are many statues inside, possibly even 1001, but I can also confirm that each one did _not_ have a thousand arms each. It was more like 10-16 arms each. Sadly, I cannot provide a photo of them, as photography was not allowed and I'm not big on disrespecting rules in people's place of worship. If you're interested in seeing, though, Google image search "sanjusangendo statues".

The rest of the day, I spent exploring Nara, the topic of my next blog post!
