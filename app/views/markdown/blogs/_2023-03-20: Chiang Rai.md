After I booked my accommodation for Chiang Rai in the van ride to Chiang Rai, our crew from the Gibbon experience got off the van in downtown. We lost Ian and Margaret because they got off at the airport (wishing them the best, back home in Canada), but we acquired some new friends who had done the shorter 2-day trip at the Gibbon Experience.

So Ditte, Lasse, Georgie, and myself from our original group, and Amy, Caoimhe (both Irish; and do _not_ ask me how to pronounce her name…), and a Polish American guy whose name I sadly forgot but who I met on the slow boat originally, from the other Gibbon Experience group, all had dinner at the Chiang Rai Night Bazaar.

This is me on the way to the ATM to pick up some shiny new Thai currency, probably because my mom asked for a photo to prove I was alive and not kidnapped (business as usual).

This was a fateful day for my culinary experience in SE Asia. Georgie introduced me to Khao Soi, a Thai curry noodle dish that is specific to the north of Thailand. It uses a coconut and yellow curry paste soup with egg noodles, a protein, and some vegetables, and is topped with crispy noodles and sometimes bean sprouts. It was instantly my favorite dish. Sadly, you’ll have to wait for a good photo of some because I didn’t get one this time.

The next day, Georgie and I made plans to see the Chiang Rai sights together. Chiang Rai is a bit spread out though, so we decided to see it by motorbike. Georgie rented a scooter from her hostel and told me she was on her way. She must have gotten lost like fifteen times though, it took her so long to get there. I was seriously worried she had crashed and died or something by the time she came around the corner. Apparently she did get lost multiple times, and even got stopped by the authorities to prove she had a license (all good).

She let me take it around the block to see what it was like. So far, I had only ridden on the back of a motorbike, never driven one myself. It was… surprisingly easy to get the hang of. I finished my lap around the block and Georgie decided I was to be our driver, which now that I think of it, is more evidence for the theory that she crashed on the way to my hostel…

So I drove us to our first destination: Baan Dam Museum, more commonly referred to as the Black House.

![Black House](/blog/images/2023-03-20_blackhouse.jpg)

It’s an art museum complex with a main building that looks like a temple that survived a fire, and many other black buildings loosely based on the architecture of temples. The art here has a dark theme to it, with a LOT of dead or angry animals as the subject, or the medium, of the artwork.

There was also a phallic theme present throughout…

Next on our list was the Blue Temple. The Blue and White Temples (more on the White Temple later) were originally fully functioning temples which fell on hard times and were falling into disrepair. First the White Temple was purchased in full by an artist and was turned into a huge work of art. Later, a disciple of the first artist did the same with the Blue Temple. Unlike the Black House, however, they still maintain their capabilities as places of worship.

We coincidentally ran into the Irish girls here, and later the Polish American as well. It would _not_ be the last time we randomly saw the Irish girls.

It’s always funny to see monks doing touristy things like taking photos at the temple. It’s more common than I expected.

Our next stop was the Big Buddha. I’m not sure if there’s a more official name for it, but everyone in the town knows what you mean if you say Big Buddha. My lunch here was some kind of sad looking rad na type dish, but I think I ordered without really knowing what I was ordering. As always, it tasted great even if it didn’t look incredible.

We noticed a bit of a storm brewing as we approached the Buddha (not sure if that’s some sort of divine sign but we ignored any ominous symbolism).

We took the elevator to the Buddha’s head after being seen into the elevator by a suspiciously large number of guards who may or may not have been in the Thai armed forces. You can see out all three of the Buddha’s eyes! This is the view from the third eye.

As we were getting our Buddha’s eye view, it started raining and hailing, _hard_. But by the time we got to the ground, it was over, leaving this very cool looking sky.

![Me in front of a cool sky after a hail storm](/blog/images/2023-03-20_coolsky.jpg)

That night happened to be the weekend night market so of course we went there for dinner. Who did we run into again? You guessed it! The Irish girls and the Polish American (I think this was the last time we saw him, but we were not done chancing upon the Irish). I got Khao Soi again, and once again it was delicious, and once again I didn’t take a photo of it. I did get a photo of this chewy, sweet but also savory black sesame pancake.

The next day we scooted to the White Temple. But not before getting pulled over by the Thai police… They were stopping all scooters (not just the tourists!) and checking for helmets and licenses. I handed the officer my MD license and he said “No, international license.” We should have had Georgie drive because it turns out British licenses work just fine when you hand them over, which we knew because she had already been stopped like this.

After a bit of an excuse about where I left my international drivers license, I was told to go into the police station. They put my name in the system and told me I owed 500 baht (about $15). I didn’t feel like I was in much of a place to bargain, even though I had heard from a guy the previous day about how his ticket was only 300 baht. So I paid the fine (bribe?) and they printed me out a copy of the ticket. They said if I got pulled over again, show them the paper and I’ll be free to go… a sort of “we already got him to pay” kind of thing. So, with everything cleared up we got back on the scooter, still unlicensed to drive, and we were free to go. The rest of the way to the White Temple was smooth sailing!

If I’m being honest, the artist’s disciple who made the Blue Temple still had a bit to learn… because the White Temple was _much_ cooler in my opinion. It was decorated incredibly ornately, and had many small mirrors on it which sparkled in the sunlight.

No photos were allowed inside, but there were very intricate paintings all over the inside. Apparently, there are hidden little references to pop culture throughout, but I forgot to look for them.

We saw even more monks on a field trip here. Their orange robes against the white and silver temple were actually quite beautiful.

As with any good Buddhist temple, the quality can be roughly predicted by the number of roofs it has. This one was not lacking.

There were other buildings on the premises like this golden building, but none were quite as impressive as the white temple itself.

Outside the temple, numerous busts of pop culture characters hung from trees like this.

After the white temple, Georgie and I took a pretty long scoot up to Tham Luang cave. You may recall that this is where a young football (soccer) team and their coach got stranded for over two weeks after entering just before a massive storm flooded the cave. The bicycles and rescue equipment by the cave entrance were a bit eerie.

![Tham Luang entrance with bicycles and rescue equipment](/blog/images/2023-03-20_caveentrance.jpg)

You were allowed to go into the cave, but just to the first chamber. It was more of an illuminated sidewalk that happened to go into a cave than any sort of spelunking.

The mountains surrounding the cave were very pretty, though you begin to see why they didn’t consider drilling into the cave from above when they were figuring out how to rescue the boys.

Nearby was the emerald pool which was kind of interesting, but more fun to see was the group of locals hanging out in a stream, with tons of kids splashing around and sitting in tubes.

We also got some oranges for free from a vendor nearby after Georgie started a conversation with them with the bit of Thai she knows. Before Laos, she was in northeast Thailand teaching English for a few months so she knows more Thai than your average backpacker.

That night we had incredible Indian food with a bunch of different curries and probably over half a dozen different chutneys.

Georgie and I temporarily said goodbye, as I was planning on going to Chiang Mai a day earlier than her.

On the day of my departure I returned to a very wonderful restaurant where Georgie and I had eaten the day before. When Georgie and I were there the first time, the owner asked us for a photo. I think it was the blond hair.

After lunch I got on the bus to Chiang Mai!
