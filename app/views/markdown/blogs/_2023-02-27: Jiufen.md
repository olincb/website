Jiufen was a gorgeous town but when we first arrived we seriously thought about skipping it and changing our accommodations to Taipei for the night, because there were __so__ many people. Once again, the long weekend had brought the masses out of Taipei and into the other parts of country. The photo doesn’t really do it justice, but there is a swarm of people around the entrance to the Jiufen Old Street, to the right of the 7-eleven.

The crowds turned what should have been a 1 minute walk to our hostel into a 10 minute one. After checking in and chatting with some people at our hostel for a bit, we went out to brave the crowds. After struggling down the main street for a while and getting stuck in a complete (and literal) standstill, we decided to get off the main alley and into some side ones which were much more pleasant.

There were parts of Jiufen that really reminded me of scenes from Spirited Away (for the second time on my trip), especially the Amei Tea House.

We stopped in for some tea with a crazy view out towards Keelung.

We experienced the tea ceremony for the umpteenth time, however it was particularly illuminating this time since we had instruction in English from a server, instead of Yifang’s (our Alishan host) just doing it without much understandable explanation. It came with some very yummy snacks, too.

The building is just so picturesque, and is magical at night too.

That evening, we took a bus down the hill to meet the couple we met in the Hualien brewery. They were on their way back from Hualien and invited us to go to the Keelung night market. They picked us up from the bus station and drove us about 20 minutes into the city. This night market was a whole other experience compared to our others. Rather than randomly walking until something looked good, their strategy was to go in with a plan, get what you want, and get out. Both approaches are very fun ways to experience it, but this way is only really possible with a local’s knowledge of the market and the language. They treated us to everything we got, which we were very appreciative of.

We caught a bus back to Jiufen and we’re able to explore the old street without the crazy crowds (though the vendors weren’t open).

The next morning, we did a morning hike to Teapot Mountain. There was a beautiful view from the top, where you could see the “Yin-Yang sea,” where the brown river meets the blue/green ocean.

Very far in the distance, on the left, you can actually see Taipei 101. It’s tiny from here though so don’t be surprised if you can’t find it.

After we checked out of our hostel, we got on a bus to Taipei, for our second visit there.
