This was the final project for ENME351: Electronics and Instrumentation II (we called it Mechatronics).
It spends about 10 seconds listening to the environment with a microphone, then for each second of listening,
it finds the closest musical note to what it heard.
It then plays the whole ~10 second tune back through a built in piezo speaker.
