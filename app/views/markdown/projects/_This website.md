This website is a work in progress.
It is meant to be a living resume, where I can show colleagues, employers, friends and family about myself, my interests, and my accomplishments.

It is a dynamic site, written in Ruby on Rails, and hosted in an AWS Lightsail instance.
The about page, as well as each individual project subpage, are compiled dynamically from markdown to HTML.
To add a new project to the site, all I have to do is write a new markdown file, put it in the correct folder, and push the changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository; the rest is handled automatically.
If you'd like to take a look at the code, it's available [on my Github](https://github.com/olincb/website).

In the future, I plan on including a page dedicated to art I've created.
I also plan on making some of my projects interactive, and making pages for them.
