This website is a work in progress.
It is a dynamic site, written in Ruby on Rails.
The about page, as well as each individual project subpage, are compiled dynamically from markdown to HTML.
For me to add a new project to the site, all I have to do is write a new markdown file and put it in the correct folder, and the rest is handled automatically.
If you'd like to take a look at the code, it's available [on my Github](https://github.com/olincb/website).
