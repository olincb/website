# Test number one!

this is a test. I will type some things. The other markdown file has some more comprehensive testing in it.
blah blah blah. words words words words words. I am typing words and i was previously ocrrecting my mistakes but nowi IWll decide not to
correct any mistakes at all I am nojnw typing without looking at the keyboard and I am still just typing words oops I hit backspace on a mistake when I dient't th want too oops I did it again it's just too hard not to coorrect your mistakes when you know you've made them.
I think I'll make another heading now.

## this is a heading

maybe I should try to make a [link](/resume) that one should go to the resume page. I'm also thinking about making an image but I'll have to
try harder for that one. here, let's try:

![this is an attempt at an image](<%= image_tag("android-chrome-192x192.png") %>)
<%= image_tag("android-chrome-192x192.png") %>

we'll see how that workds. that's probablyenough for this guy should be enouch words in there.
